id me commissurum ut patiar fieri ne animum induxeris.

Facile palmam habes: hic uictust: uicit tua comoedia.

Lysiteles: ibi de istis rebus plura fabulabimur.
Lv. Nil ego in occulto agere soleo: meus ut animust

e'loquar :

704. ne . . . induxeris: the
leading clause; ut patiar id fieri
depends upon me commissurum.

705. nonenim: cf. Capt. 568 n.
—non possum (potest) quin: used
in six other places in Pl. and nequeo
quin in four3 in Trin. 730 fieri is
added, but the other passages
support each other, and fizcere, fieri
should not be supplied.— The
first half of this line is quoted bya
speaker in the dialogue of Cicero’s
de Oratore, II. 39, to excuse an
interruption. — πάλιν, encore.

706 ff. There is no reference,
direct or indirect‚ in Latin litera-
ture which warrants the supposi-
tion that there were contests on
the Roman stage between different
poets. Plautus must, therefore,
have taken 706 directly from the
Greek original, without regard for
the fact that the allusion would be
unintelligible to the audience and
perhaps without understanding it
himself. The textos 708 is con-
fused, turis being unintelligible,
but the meaning of the two lines is,
⁶ He acts more in harmony with the

plot and keeps better time. For
your folly Ι will fine you a mina)—
uersus : cf. Stich. 770, si istoc me
uersu viceris . . . The sudden
change from a comparison of plays
to a comparison of actors, the
confusion of persons (hic, 706, is
Lesbonicus ; hic, 707, is Lysiteles;
tua, 706, Lysiteles; te, 708, Les-
bonicus), and the reference to the
infliction of fines upon actors all
show that these VSS. are a late in-
terpolation.

709 f. See Introd. 13 b. In all
these questions quid tibi means
what reght leave you to. . . ἲ or
wlzat do you mean by . . .? It
could not mean how, quomodo, but
Stasimus twists it into that sense
by retorting eodem modo, i.e.,
pedibus. The leading verb in the
reply would properly be accessi3
the effect of interchanging the
verbs is to make the sentence mean,
‘Vou may learn how Ι got in by
seeing how I now get out.' With
these words he retreats quickly into
the background from which he had
come forward to speak, 705.
