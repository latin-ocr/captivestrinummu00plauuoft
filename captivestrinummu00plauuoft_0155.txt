TRINVMMVS 101 ’

Argentum amanti homini adulescenti„animi impoti,
Qui exaedificaret suam incohatam ignauiam?

CA. Non ego illi argentum redderem?

re'dderes

ME. Non

Neque de 1‘110 quicquam neque emeres neque uenderes

Nec qui deterior esset faceres copiam.

135

Inconciliastin eum qui mandatust tibi,

Ille qui mandauit e'um exturbasti ex ae'dibus.
Edepol mandatum pulcre et curatum probe.
Crede huic tutelam : suam melius rem gesserit.

CA. Subigis maledictis me tuis, Megaronides,

140

Nouo modo adeo ut quo'd meae concreditumst
Taciturnitati clam, fide et fiduciae,

- Ne enuntiarem quoiquam neu facerem palam,
Vt mihi necesse s1't iam id tibi concredere.

ME. Mihi qu6d credideris, sumes ubi posiueris.

quid interest, and the logical ex-
pression of the thought would
require dare ei gladium as the
subject of interest rather than
dare argentum, but the inaccu-
racies do not go beyond the limits
of colloquial carelessness.

132. exaedificaret, etc„ complete
the edifice of lzissolly, an unusual
figurative use. Cf. the different
sense in 1127.

133. non . . . redderem? an
exclamatory sentence, repudiating
the suggestion of the preceding
speech. The imperf. subjunc. re-
tains its past tense meaning,—

. You mean tlzat [should not . . ..Ρ

Though the subjunc. is jussive,
non is the regular negati‘ve in
such exclamations.

136. inconciliastin: the verb
means in ΡΙ. to make trouble, to
lead into defficulties, and appears
to contain the negative in· which

145

in general is compounded only
with adjectives and adverbs.

137. ille z attracted into the
case of qui; cf. illum quem, 985,
and Capt. 1 n.

139. huic: Megaronides; crede

is general and the {vhole is sar—
castic. Here’s a fine man to acl
as guardian. The subject of ges-
serit is indefinite, the person to
whom M. might be lutor, but of
course with special reference to
Lesbonicus.

144. ut: repeated from 141 be-
cause of the long interruption. So
Pseud. 5803 583; Aul. 792 f.. and
prius quam . . . prius, Pseud. 524.

145. sumes ubi ε as if the
secret were a deposit of money,
placed in a certain spot. The
figure is rather common in Pl.—
posiueris : the only form used in
Pl.; posui came in with the dac-
tylic poets.
