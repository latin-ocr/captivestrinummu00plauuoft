INTROImCTION. xv

to say that it is conversational Latin. It is such Latin as
would have been spoken by a quick-witted man with a great
command of language and a strong sense of humor, and it
shows in many ways the peculiarities of colloquial language.
The range of thought is limited‚ yet the vocabulary is rich
and is used with a kind of profusion‚ as though the writer
had never been at a loss for a word. Many fixed and idio-
matic phrases recur again and again, and the reader who
has read two or three plays with care will find little that is
absolutely new in other plays, except the occasional rare
words. In their meaning the words not infrequently differ
from classical usage, either because they have not yet
acquired the prevailing classical sense, or because they are
colloquially wrested from their strict meaning. Many words,
especially adjectives, are used with little discrimination‚ until
their proper sense is entirely lost (ag. lepidus, scelestus),
superlatives are used with little more meaning than the posi-
tive, and frequentative verbs are employed where the simple
verb would have expressed the idea equally well. These Ι
same characteristics are found in all colloquial speech. In
slang terms‚ that is, in words twisted out of their proper
sense for comie effect, Plautus is particularly rich, especially
in nouns and verbs which express cheating‚ of which a long
list might be given, some of them corresponding to English
slang, and in terms of abuse and endearment, which occa-
sionally fill three or four lines. Plautus also coins words
freely, not only in such proper names as Thensaurochrysonico-
chrysides (Capt. 285) and Vaniloquidorus Virginisuendo-
uides (Pers. 702 ff), but also in more ordinary compounds
and derivatives‚ where the meaning would at once explain
itself to the hearer.

10. As might be expected, the free use of a large vocabu-
lary leads often to redundancy of expression, such as char-
acterizes all conversation. In the effort to attain to clearness
