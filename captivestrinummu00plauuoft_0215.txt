Eo conductor melius de me nugas conciliauerit.
Vt ille me exornauit, ita sum ornatus: argentum hoc

facit.

lpse ornamenta a chorago haec sumpsit suo periculo:
Nunc ego si potero ornamentis hominem circumducere,
Dabo operam ut me esse ipsum plane sycophantam

sentiat.

minis facies: mira sunt
Ni illic homost aut dormitator aut sector zonarius.

855 ff. The quid amplius is
described in 859; the sycophanta
is thinking of some trick by which
he may get away with the hired
costume which he wears. His
argument is, ‘The old man hired
me at a low price to do his swin-
dling. 1 will add a little on my
own account and thereby give him
so much the better bargain (eo
melius conciliauerit) and show
him that I am a better swindler
than he thought (860).’—melius z
bene and male in all degrees are
often used of good and bad bar-
gains with nendo, emo, concilio, etc.
—ita sum ornatus : i.e., these fine
clothes are of his providing. -- hoc
facit: zie„ provides the dress.—
choi-argus, tlte costumer, who sup-
plied the dress for the actors. Cf.
Capt. prol. 61, where comico cllo-
ragio means, “m'th the costumes
suited to a comedy‚'’ and Pseud.
1 184, where a supposed swindler is
asked how much he paid the cos-
tumer for the hire of his dis-

guise. — suo periculo : by giving
a guarantee for the return of the
clothes. — ornamentis ε Introd.
17 b. For ornamenta of the cos-
tume suited to a part, see Capt.
615.—The ut-clause depends on
dabo operam, ‘I will do my best
to let him know.' [Brix makes si
potero depend upon dabo ope-
ram (‘I will try to see whether,‘
cf. 763) with ut . . . sentiat as a
clause of purpose].—ipsum‚ in
my own person, without any di-
rections from him.

861. mira sunt ni, I should not
be surprisetl if. Cf. n. on mirum
quin, 495, and Capt. 805 n.

862. dormitator occurs only
here and in 984. below. In the
second passage it is applied to the
man after it is plain that he is
some kind of a swindler3 it there-
fore cannot mean a thies who sleeps
by day, as the older commentators
took it. Perhaps trifler; cf. dor-
mitas 981. [Brix.] — sector zona-
rius, βαλαντιοτόμος, a pickpocket‚
