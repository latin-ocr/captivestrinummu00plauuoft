[11. 4. 138.

Nam fulguritae sunt alternae 1 zirborcs:

Multo Syrorum iam antidit patientia.

Sed iste'st ager profe'cto, ut te audiui loqui,
Malos in quern omnes publice mitti decet.
Sicut fortunatorum memorant insulas,

Quo cuncti qui aetatem egerint caste suam

539. The hiatus after alternae
has been avoided by various con-
jectures, alternas (nom. plu.,
Ritschl). alternis (Spengel). no
one of which is entirely satisfac-
tory. It is possible that anginad
with the old d of the abl. prevented
hiatus in the next vs.

544. solstitiali morbo: either
sunstroke or the fever of the Cam-
pagna, which is especially preva—
lent during the heat of summer
(solstitium ) .

545. Campans genus: a Ro-
man allusion, added by l'lautus.
During the operations of 212—
211 με. some of the Campa-
nian towns opened their gates to
Hannibal and the Campanians
acted as his allies in the defense
of Capua. This passage, which
implies that Campanian slaves
were used as farm laborers, ex-
presses the Roman hostility to the
allies who had revolted, and some

special slur, which we cannot now
understand, is no doubt contained
in the lines.

549. The reference to the

“isles of the blessed '' is of course -

from the Greek original, as are
all allusions to Greek myth and
leg-gidi. istoc, istius modi: with

the proper zd pers. force, to the ⁹·

place you speak os, such as you de-
clare it to be.—quidem adds a
restrictive force to qui and with
istius gives an ironical color to
the clause; ‘supposing, that is,
that it is such as you say that it
is.'

553. hospitiumst calamitatis:
cf. damni conciliabulum, 314. Such
vivid and humorous phrases show
Plautus at his best, as a master in
the conversational style.
