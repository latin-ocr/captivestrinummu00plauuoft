Mittam.
Tu istuc age.

CHARMIDES

SENEX

Salsi'potenti et multipotenti Iouis fratri et Nerei Nep-

tuno

820

Laetus lubens laudes ago et grates gratiasque habeo

et fluctibus salsis,

Quos pe'nes mei fuit summa potestas, bonis mi's quid

foret et meae uitae,

817. meditatum, wellprepared.
So Mil. Glor. 903, of persons pre-
pared to carry out a trick.

819. actum reddam: cf. trans-
actum reddet, Capt. 34 5 n. — nuga-
cissume : not in tlze most trgflt'trgr
mamzer, as the Lex. defines it,
but so as to carry out tlze trz'ck com—
pl2·te{11,· nugae in the comedy fre-
quently passes from its original
meaning, trzfles, to the meaning
tricks.

Megaronides goes off to the
forum and Calliclesinto his house.
The stage is empty for a moment,
but there is no pause in the action.

NINTH SCENE. Charmides
comes in from the left side of the
stage, wearing a dloak (chlamys or
paenula) anda broad-brimmed hat
(petasus, Pseud. 7 3 5).

This short canticum in anapaestic
octonarii is free from the vague-
ness of thought which character-
izes some of the more elaborate
cantica. It is a good specimen of
the cantica in a single meter, like
Bacch. 385 ff. ; 925 ff„ and ex-
hibits in a rather marked degree

the distinctive features of the half-
lyrical popular verse, the asynde-ta
(spurcificurm inmanem, intole-
randum, uesanum; frangere,
ruere„ scindere), the alliterations
(laetus lubens laudes3 grates
gratias; pauperibus parcere;
diuites damnare atque domare,
mendicis modesti; pax propi-
tia), the fulness of expression (821 ;
omnia item una mecum, 8343
quasi . . . haud secus. 835).
These lines deserve careful atten-
tion. There is scarcely a character-
istic of the style of Plautus except
the idioms proper to dialogue,
which is not illustrated here.

820 f. Neptuno: dat. after the
whole of 821, ago and habeo,
and et fluctibus salsis is added
as a second half-comic object of
thanks.

„822 quos penes: for the order,
cf. Amph. 653; Hor. Ars. Post.
72. quem penes. — mis z meis ,· cf.
‹t'1'.v=dc1's.—b0nis, uitae: dat.

milzifict postea ? what will huppen
to me ?
