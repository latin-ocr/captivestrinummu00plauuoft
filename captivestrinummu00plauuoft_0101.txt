TYN. Quia tute ipse eges in patria nec tibi qui uiuas
domist,

Omnis inueniri similis tui uis. non mirum facis :

E‘st miserorum ut maleuolentes sint atque inuideant
bonis.

AR. Hegio, uide sis, nequid tu huic te'mere insistas
cre'dere:

Atque ut perspicio, profecto iam aliquid pugnae edidit :

Filium tuom quod redimere se ait, id ne utiquam mihi

TYN. Scio te id nolle fi'eri : efficiam tamen ego id, si

aliquid pugnae edidit, has played
you some trick ; cf. Cic. ad A tt. 1.
