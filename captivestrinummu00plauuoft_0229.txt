scias.

emphatic and ironical.

1023. unus, any one. —solum‚
the sole of the shoe.

1025. The ἐπιθήκη is the bonus,
something given over and above
the amount agreed upon. If Sta-
simus tried to recover his ring he
would not succeed, but would only
add the wasted trouble as ἐπιθήκη
to the loss.

8. 2, quod uides perisse perditum
ducas.

ored rather than these evil ways'

basilicas edictiones. —facinora in-
ceptat loqui: cf. 884, magnum
fizct'nus incipissis petere.

1031. To a Roman audience
these lamentations about the pass-
ing away of the good old-fashioned
sense of honesty would be espe-
cially humorous from a slave. At
the close of the Second Punic
XVar the Roman national charac-
ter underwent a great change,
which was a part of its natural de-
velopment from a city people to a
world race, but which seemed to
the conservatives like Cato noth-
ing but a process of degeneration
and decay. Plautus is here paro—
dying the complaints of the con-
servatives.
