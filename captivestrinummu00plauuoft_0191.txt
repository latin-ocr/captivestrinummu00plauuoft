585. dare: 1‘.e.‚ in marriage.
The last syllable is taken as long
before the change of speakers, as
it would be at the end of a vs.

590. enumquam: used in ex-
clamatory questions five times in
Pl„ Rud. 987 ; 1117, etc„ twice in
Ter., and occasionally in later
Latin, with an interrogative iudefi-
nite sense, like that of ecquis,
with which it may be connected.
Translate here, shall lever seeyou ?

59¹- impetraui abiret: para-
taxis (Introd. 26 a), not an omis-
sion of ut. It is much less fre-
quent with the impf. 3d sing. than
with pres.‚ but the following cases
occur: Bacch. 551, accuratum lca-
buit. . . faceret ; Bacch. 1047, multo
mauellem foret ; Pers. 634, rogarat
. . . diceret, Marc. 537. Cf. also
Trin. 115. 111 the 3d plu. Mil.
Glor. 54, siui uiuerent.—di, uo-

to the gods for help, but in the
common use in Pl. the words are
merely expletive.

592. gestam: supply rem, acc.
of exclamation. The thought is
that all is turning out well in spite
of the bad beginning.

594. ea re: Introd. 17 a.—
fuat z* cf. Capt. 260 n.

595. de collo meo-——de me, as
uae capiti tuo= uae tibi. This use
of collum, however, though familiar
enough in Engl. through the use of
hanging as a mode of execution,
is not found elsewhere in Latin,
and the word was doubtless se-
lected in order to play upon the
literal meaning in the next line.
The arms and baggage would be
hung about his neck and shoulders
on the march.
