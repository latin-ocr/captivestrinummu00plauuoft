thought and the absence of a sub-
ject for effugiet make it probable
that a vs. has fallen out after 596,
as Ritschl thought.

598. malam crucem: cf. Capt.
469 n.

599. latrocinatum‚ to serve as a
mercenary soldier. So in Mil.
Glor. 74 the captain calls the men
whom he has recruited latrones.
The meaning rabber is secondary.
The frequent references in comedy
to mercenary soldiers and bragging
captains are all from the Greek.
The Roman soldiers were still
citizens.

SIXTH SCENF„ As Stasimus is
turning to go away Callicles comes
hurriedly out of his house, having
heard of the betrothal. IIe ques-
tions Stasimus somewhat sharply,
and Staaimus, believing that (jal-
licles has cheated his master (601,
615 ft), replies as impudently as
he dares.

602. quomodo . . . dixti? what’s
that you said? quomodo is some-
times used literally and unemo-
tionally‚ but it is also used either
with a verb (always 2d pers. perf.
of a verb of saying) or alone, to
demand a repetition. The latter
is the sense here. Stasimus first
answers the question as it was
meant, by a repetition of the state-
ment, and then adds em, hoc
modo, as if quomodo had been
literal. Cf. Pseud. 343 for a simi-
lar play upon the word. It should
be noticed that Stasimus had not
said this in the preceding scene,
nor is there any indication that
Callicles overheard the conversa·
tion between Lesbonicus and
Philto. Plautus is often careless
in such matters.—- nostrum erilem
f ilium, our master's son, noster erus
being treated as a kind of com-
pound noun; Mil. Glor. 458 3 549.
etc.
