ERGASILVS

PARASITVS

quentus nomen indidit Scorto mihi,

Eo quia inuocatus 50’160 6336 in conuiuio. 70
Scio absurde dictum hoc derisores dicere,

At ego aio recte: narn scortum in conuiuio

Amator, talos quom iacit, sibi inuocat.

Estne inuocatum scortum an non? planissume.
Verum he'rcle uero nos parasiti planius, 75
Quos numquam quisquam neque uocat neque inuocat.
[Quasi mures semper edimus alienum cibum.]

Vbi re's prolatae sunt, quom rus homines eunt,

Simul prolatae res sunt nostris dentibus.

Quasi, quom caletur, cocleae in occulto latent, 80

ter, it is probable that the pro-
logue as we have it contains the
work of three persons, — Plautus,
the writer of 8-16, and the writer
of 46—51.

Fmsr SCENF.. Ergasilus, the
parasite, comes upon the stage
from the right. His speech is
addressed directly to the audience,
with no attempt to keep up the
illusion of a soliloquy.

69. Scorto: the dat. is usual,
though not invariable, with nomen
est, facit, etc.; Sticlz. 174, Gelasimo
nomen milti indidit paruo pater,
and a parasite introduces himself,
as here, in lllen. 77, iuuentus nomen
ficit Peniculo mihi.

70. inuocatus‚ uninvitcd, as
applied to the parasite; invokcd.
in the other sense; so Cure. 356,
the soldier inuocat Planesium, his
mistress, as he throws the (lice.
Cf. the puns upon inuitus and in·
uitare, Trin. 27; Rud. 811.

71. derisores: not those who

had given the name, but rivals of
Erg., who derided him out of
envy, and against whom the fol-
lowing argument is directed.

74. planissume: as a term of
strong assent; also Ps. 365, Ter.
Phorm. 771, and this suggests
planius, 75.

77. This vs. is found also Pers.
58 (but edere for edimus), where
it is in place. Here it was written
in as a gloss, because it applies to
the life of a parasite.

78. res prolatae : in the courts
and in public business (Cic. adAtt.
XIV. 5), and the point of the next
vs. lies in the formality of the
phrase.

80. quasi: not with quom,but
introducing latent, uiuont. 'l‘he
use of qnasi in actual (not imagi-
nary) comparisons is rare except
in early Latin: Asin. 178, quasi
piscis. itidemst amator .· T rin. 8 3 5.
ita iam quasi canes .· l‘s. 199, quasi
Dircam . . . dcuinxcre, item ego te
