111. 1. 14.] TRINVMMVS 137

ST. At tu edepol nullus creduas :
Si».

Non credibile dices.

Si ho'c non credis, ego credidero -— CA. Quid?
Me nili pendere.

CA. Quam dudum istuc ai'it ubi actumst?
hic ante ostium :

Tam modo, inquit Praenestinus.
perdita

Quam 1'n re salua Lesbonicus factus est frugalior? 610

ST. Atque quidem ipsus ultro uenit Philto oratum filio.

CA. Flagitium quidem hercle fiet, nisi dos dabitur uirgini.

Postremo edepol ego istam rem ad me attinere intellego :

ibo ad meum castigatorem atque ab eo consilium petam.

ST. Propemodum quid illic festinet se'ntio et subole't

ST. ilico,

CA. Tanton in re

mihi :

606. dices: the future idea lies
in credibile, though expressed in
the verb, as if it were ‘ What you
say will not prove worthy of be-
lies! The use is not infrequent
in comedy, eg„ Mil. δίον. 395,
narrandum ego istuc militi censebo
(where the future idea is expressed
twice); Mil. 1209, deos sperabo
teque, i.e.‚ ‘1 hope that you and
the gods will help me.‘— nullus:
used colloquially as a perhaps
stronger equivalent of non, ne,-
so especially in nullus snm, which
Donatus (Ter. And. III. 4. 20)
says is stronger than perii.

607. me nili pendere, that l
don't care, i.e., whether you believe
it or not.

608. ilico: used in Pl. more fre-
quently of time, but also of place,
especially in combination with hic,
rzjgrlzt ltere. This passage allows
either sense; ilico may answer
quarn dudum and hic ante os-
tium would answer ubi. [So
Langen, Beitr. 158 f.]. But I pre-
fer to take it of place and make

615

tarn modo the answer, in reversed
order, to quam dudum.

609. tarn modo: the correct
Latin would be modo. Cf. Truc.
691, where conca or com'a is said to
be the Praenestine form foi· ciconia.
Cf. Campans Ξ Campanus, 545.

610. frugalior: ironically, since
Callicles thought that Lesbonicus
was refusing to give the dowry
and was intending to use the price
of the property for his own pleas-
ures. The positivefrugalis does
not occur in class. Latin, frugi,
indecl„ being used in its place.
Quintilian (Ι. 6. 17) says that the
use offi¹7«⁷alis was Offensive ped-
antry (molestissima dilzjgrentiae per-
uersitas). But fi'ugalior, fruga-
litas, frugaliter show that it must
once have been in use.

611. atque: cf. 336 n.; Capt.
355 n.—filio: dat. of advantage.

613. postremo, in short. This
line and the following one are
spoken aside.

614. castigatorem: Megaroni-
des.
