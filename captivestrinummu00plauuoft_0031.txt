INTRODUCTIUN. xxiii

c) eadem, eadem opera, “ut the same time ’³ (Most. 1039; capt.
293, 459; Mil. Glor. 303, ete), is always used of two future acts which
are to be performed at the same time, and usually with fut. or fut. perf.
To be distinguished from una opera . . . qua, “as well . . . as.”

d) quisquis, quisque, and quicumque, all containing a duplication
of the indes. interrog. quis, are not yet fully differentiated in use ι so
quoquo modo, stlcn. 827, ‘⁶ in every way ''; unum quidquid, Trite. 881,
for unum quidque; quidquid, illest. 831, etc., all non-relative, and
so even in Cicero. For plur. of quisquis, quicumque is used. quisque
is used for quisquis or quicumque (as indef. rel.) : Mil. Glor. 156,
quemque in tegulis uideritis alienum; 160; Gzpt. 798, quemque
offendero, “ whomsoever 1 meet,’' and often; also in late Latin.
quilubet is in Pl. only partially felt as a componud, but quiuis some—
what more clearly.

e) In early Latin quis, indes. or interrog„ had no fem. form (cf.
Greek τίς), and in l‘l. quae is just coming into use. So quis, quisquis,
quisquam, quisque, quempiam, ete„ all fem„ but no ease of fem.
aliquis or ecquis. Fem. quae, indes. οι· interrog, is also used, but less
frequently: Mil. σίων. 361, illaec quis est mulier? [llere. 684,
nescio quaest mulier intus.

20· a) Adverbs are often used in predicate after esse, which was
originally not a mere copula: Ps. 240, ita er0; 677, sie erit, etc„ and
so ut, bene, male, palam, frustra, etc. An adj. and an adv. are used
together, with verbs which take either: lllen. 1073, stulte dixi atque
inprudens; Trin. 268, miseros maleque habeas. Both of these
constructions appear also in later Latin.

b) Double negatives: neque . . . numquam, Ps. 136; neque . . .
haud, Bacch. 19, 1037; Pers. 535 ; Epid. 664, etc. ; non . . . nemini,
Mil. Glor. 1411. Probably a colloquialism 3 also in Petronius, Apuleius,
and Gellius.

c) nec, not connective = neque, but Ξ ne-que, “not in any way,'’
“not at all '’ z neeullum, Trin. 2823 nec recte dicere Ξ male dicere,
lllost. 240; Ps. 10853 Asin. 155, 471, etc. This usage is found also in

later Latin, and should not be explained by supplying another member
to the sentence.

TENSES.

21. Most of the peculiarities in the use of the tenses are
colloquia13 some are due to early relationships between
tenses, eg. between fut. indic. and pres. subjunc., perhaps
