268. utrum . . . -ne . . . an:
this occurs six times in Pl. in
direct questions; utrum has al-
most its proper meaning, wlziclz of
two.— dicam: almost like Engl.
‘but whether I am to think that
he will . . . ’ ; it is inserted in cer-
tain forms of question (quis-ques-
tions, direct or indirect, depending
upon nescio, and indirect disjunc-
tive questions with nescio) as a
fuller expression of uncertainty.
Cf. 533, 541, and quid uis reddam ,9
—strictimt i.e.‚ slmve with a
razon—per pectinem : trim the
beard with shears over a comb.

he makes good use of his oppor-
tunity.—usque: absolute, ‘thor-
oughly'; Poen. 701, replebo usquc .·

usque attondit ; Hor. S. Ι. 2. 65,
usquc superque: with admutilarc,
Mil. 768.—probe, first-rate; a
very common use of this adv. in
Pl. The whole is a bit of slang,
Ιιι1 will ις’·ιὶυε lzt'm a thorouglz good
sltearing.

270. quid tu? an introductory
question, to call attention to the
question which is to follow. So

l's. 610, quid tu? seruosne cs an
liber? and with other pronouns,
279, or nouus, 281, 282. No defi-
nite verb is to be supplied. Transl.
What about yon ? How is it with
you? — memora, tell mc, the
usual sense in Pl.

271. longissume and a rnalo

273. familiaris filius: i.e.‚filius

cf. paterfizmiliczs. Somethinglike

274. Thales is a type of wisdom
in Pl„ Rud. 10033 Bacch. 122, the
passages being no doubt taken
from the Greek original. — ta-
lento, even for a talent ,· we should
expect a very small price, but ta-
lentum is used for the pun with
T(h)ales.

27 5. ad, in comparison with ,·
a somewhat rare meaning (Mil.
δίον. 968), but found in Cic. and
Liv .

This is the prevailing sense in P1.;
the meaning witly, jocose is rare.
