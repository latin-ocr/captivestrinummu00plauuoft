10 PLAVTI

[1. 1. 13.

Suo sibi suco uluont, ros si n‹'›n cadit:
Item parasiti rebus prolatis latent
ln occulto miseri, uictitant suco suo,

Dum ruri rurant homines quos ligt'irriant.

Sunius: quando res redierunt, Molossici

odiosicique ct multum incommodestici.

here and Truc. 65. quom caletur
maxumc.

83. in occulto: Introd. 47.

84. rurant, which occurs only
here and in a quotation from
Varro. is chosen for the figura
cqzrmolqgrica with ruri. Cf. Introd.

85 ff. uenatici: because they
are so thin.—Molossici: large
and fierce mastisfs, kept as watch-
‹l‹›‚t:s; cf. Lucr. V. 10(›3; Verg. G.
lll..405; llor.S. 11.6.114. The
following words, odiosici‚ in-
commodestici, are coined as if
they were the names of breeds of
dogs. — In 86 quind6 is a spon-
‹laic word in the 2d foot, which is
contrary to the usage of l'l. Α
spondee is common, but a spondaic
word in the :d foot is found only
a few times.

89. potis : for potis est, potest.
The fact that pote, potis was regu-
larly used with cst gave it a slight
verbal force, so that it could be
used alone for potes, potest, and
possa— -que connects the two
objects of perpeti, colaphos and

frangi aulas (=ollas‚ cf. Aulu-
laria). The custom here alluded
to, of breaking dishes filled with
ashes upon the heads of parasites,
was Greek, and is mentioned in
fragments of the New Comedy
and several times in Pl. (Pers. 60;
Curc. 396; Amph. Frag. 111.), but
not elsewhere in Latin literature.

90. uel: intensive, as very often
in Pl.—portam Trigeminam:
this gate,pr0bably named from its
triple entrance, was between the
Aventine and the Tiber, but it is
not known whether ad saccum
refers to the Roman custom of
begging at the gates (Trin. 423)
or to the occupatiori of a portet,
which Alciphron, ΙΙΙ. 7, speaks of
as the last refuge of a parasite. —-
ilicet : see 469 n.

92. postquam: this is taken
up in nunc, 985 the parenthetic
explanation runs rapidly at first,
but leads off into the lament of
96-97, and the thought of 98 does
not take up precisely the argu-
ment which was begun in 92.—
rex: as the name of a parasite’s
