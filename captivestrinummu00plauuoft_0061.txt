’ Erg. or to Hegio.

1. 2. 62]

CAP'I'IVI 15

Quia minc remissus cst edendi exercitus.

HE. Nullumne interea nactas, qui posset tibi
Remissum quem dixti imperare exercitum ? 155
ERG. Quid credis? fugitant omnes hanc prouinciam.
[Quoi obtigerat postquam captus est Philopolemus

tuus.]

HE. Non pol mirandumst fugitare hanc prouinciam.
Multis ct multigeneribus opus e'st tibi

Militibus : primumdum opus est Pistorensibus, 160
Eorum sunt aliquot genera Pistorensium,

Opus Paniceis est, opus Placentinis quoque,

Opus Turdetanis, o'pust Ficedulensibus,

Iam maritumi omnes milites opus sunt tibi.

ERG. Vt saepe summa ingenia in occulto' latent : ι(55

interrupted by Erg. For hiatus,
see Introd. 48 b.

From this point to the end of
the scene the speakers are con-
fused in the MSS„ and the words
are such that they might, with
slight changes, be given either to
huic, 1 2,
must be supposed to be explainsed
by a gesture, and the sense would
be, (Heg.) ‘ Keep up agood heart.’
(Erg.) ‘Alasl it is not my heart
but my stomach (huic) that aches.’
This is somewhat forced, but giv-
ing huic . . . exereitus to Heg.
(so the MSS.) introduces still
more serious complications. On
the other objection‚ that the jokes
are not suited to the character of
Hegio, see Introd. 51.

153. remittere exercitum and
imperare exercitum : the techni-
cal terms for disbanding an army
and for assuming command. For
the metaphor, see Introd. 11.

160 ff. The names of troops pun
upon names of articles of food and
names of towns: Pistorensibus

from pistor (miller, baker) and
Pistoria in Etruria, Placentinis
from placenta and Placentia on
the Po, Turdetanis from turdus
and perhaps a Spanish tribe whose
name might have become known
through the military operations
during the Second Punic W'ar.
The geographica] reference of
Paniceis (panis) and Ficedulen-
sibus (ficedula, a small bird) can
only be guessed at. The last vs„
of course, refers to fish.

164. milites opus sunt: the
predicate use of opus is probably
the original one (cf. Most. 412, id
uiri doctist opus). The instru-
mental abl. (1603 2253 Alost. 25¹)
is more common and was perhaps
formed on the analogy of the abl.
with the verba} noun usus (Amph.
5053 Ba. 706 f.; Trin. 503 f.).
Plautus has also after opus the
infin. (Pers. 584), the acc. and infin.
(Ba. 989), the subjunc. with ut
(Truc. 500) and without (Merc.
1004), and possibly the acc. (cf.
Truc. 902 ff. with Ps. 385).
