104 PLAVTI

[1. 2. 141.

Qui emisset, eius essetne ea pecunia?

limi egomet potius aedis: argentum dedi

Thensauri causa, ut saluom amico traderem.

180

Neque tideo hasce erni mfhi nec usurae meae:
1111 redemi russum, a me argentum dedi.
Haec sunt: sirecte seu peruorsc facta sunt,
Ego mc'· fecisse confiteor, Megaronides.

Em mea malefacta, Ι em meam auaritiam tibi.

185

Hasce mihi propter res malas famas ferunt.

Mn. Παῦσαιε uicisti castigatorem tuom.

Occlusti linguam: n1'l est quod respondeam.

CA. Nunc ego te quaeso ut me opera et consilio iuues

Communicesque hanc mecum meam prouinciam.

ME. Polliceor operam.
ΜΕ. Domi:

indicarem. Cf. redderem, red-
deres, ¹33-

181. neque adeo: asomewhat
frequent 6011111111311011, 918, Cape.
348, in which adeo has lost some-
thing of its proper force; ‘not
surely,' ‘and certainly . . . not)

182. illi: Charmides. The
tautology of red-erni russum
would not be felt more than in
the Hugh, “I have bought it
back againff' Both rursum and
russum are well supported by the
MSS.

185. ern: not to be confused,
as it is in Harper's Lexicon, with
hcm, the emotional interjection,
or with the interrogative en. It
is of demonstrative origin and is
used with demonstrative force;
with other demonstratives, as in
vs. 3. with adverl›s‚ em nunc, with
verbs, em desino, with impv.‚ em
uide, and as here with an acc. of
exclamation. The acc. might
stand alone, but' by association

190

CA. Ergo ubi eris paulo post?

with em it is felt to be in some
degree dependent upon it. —
There is 311 unexplained and per-
haps incorrect hiatus after mal&
facta.

136 may serve as an example
of the cases in which the two
families of MSS. (Introd. 6) give
different readings, either of which
would suit the place. The line is
printed as it is found in the Milan
palimpsest. In the Palatine MSS.
it is an exclamation: Hasclne
[me] propter res mdledicas famds
serunt. — ferunt, circulata.

187. παῦσαιι perhaps this stood
in the Greek play at this point and
was brought over by Plautus with-
out translation in order to highten
the effect by the sudden introduc-
tion of a foreign word. Cf. οἴχεται,
41 .

190. prouinciam: largely used
in Pl. of any duty or business;
here of the guardianship, of the
treasure.
