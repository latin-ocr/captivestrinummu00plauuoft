Neque spurcidici insunt uorsus ininieniorz'tbiles:

llic neque periurus lenost nec meretrix mala

Neque miles gloriosus: ne ucresiniini,

Foris illic extra scaenam fient proelia. ⁶0

Nrun hoc paene iniquomst‚ comico choragio

Abeo.

ualcte, iudices iustissumi,

Domi duellique duellatores optumi.

56. immemorabiles, which
should nat lte· spoken, from the
sense of memorare, spcak‚ tvll,
which is the usual one in l¹l.

60. foris illic extra scaenam :
this kind of pleonasrn belongs
properly to colloquial style, and
is therefore very common in l’l.:
illic ihs, 100ος ibidem in Alide, 26;
ponc aedem Castoris ihi, Curc. 481;
lum (gitur, (gitur demum, etc.;
Introd. 10.

61. paene iniquomst‚ quite un-
jusI. For this sense of paene, cf.
Mil. 408 f., paene perdidisti, . . .
absumplu's pacm· .· Rud. 1204, ni-
mis pac-nc: Aul. 466, paenissume.
—choragio: the costumes and
stage properties suitable for a
comedy could not be used for a
tragedy. choragus is the contrac-
tor who provided costumes, Trin.
858, and n.; Curc. 464.

67. iudices: this can be used
only in a general way. ‘judges of
cmnedy! for except Trin. 706, uicit
tua mmm-dia. and a few appeals
like the present, there is nothing
in the plays or in the didascaliae

which points to regular contests
between different authors, as in
Greece.

68. duelli, duellatores=bclli‚
bellatores. So in many inser. and
in old laws. Cf. duonor0=honffi
rum, in the second Scipio epitaph,
Duelcmai = Bellonae, S. C. de Bac„
and bis for duis.

The prologue cannot be wholly
by Plautus. Vs. 12, with the ref-
erence to fixed seats, cannot be
earlier than 146 n.c., when perma-
nent seats were first introduced.
With 12 must go 11-16‚ and prob-
ably 8-10 also. Vss. 21-22 are
out of place where they stand,
and there is no other place where
they fit in well, though Brix puts
thern after 4. Vss. 46—49 and 50-
51 merely condense what is said
just before. and 48 is perhaps an
interpolation. But the plot is one
which requires explanation, and
there is no reason for doubting
that 1—7, 24-45‚ 52-68 are from
the original prologue. While,
therefore, it is impossible to reach
certain conclusione in such a mat-
