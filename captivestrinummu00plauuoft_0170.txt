328. illi: repeating the idea of
huic because of the intervening
clause. 'l‘he regular pronoun for
this 'ts is, Pseud. 528 f.; 7¹9, etc.
-neuis (= non uis) : the proper
form of the zd pers. of nolo, since
the verb is compounded of nc and
uolo. Later, when ne had been
supplanted by nnn as the negative,
with indic. non was substituted for
nt in forms where it did not coa-
lesce with the verb.-— nempe de
tuo? is only partially interroga-
tive; at your own expense, l sup-
pose you mean. The phrase re-
minds Lysiteles that, being under
his father's power, he has no prop-
erty of his own.

33¹- publicis . . . negotiis: i.e.,
those public offices which required
an expenditure of money, often in
large amounts, from the persons
holding them. — adfinis: else-
where in Pl. a connection by mar-
riage; here it is in the earlier sense
of connected with, engaged in, in
which sense it is us'ed by Terence

and Cicero. Cf. corpus uitiis
adfine, Lucr. 111. 733.

332. mercaturan: sc. rem per-
‹l1‘‹l1't‚· then for a 2d abl. is sub-
stituted the clause uenalis (seruos)
habuit and this requires a repeti-
tion οἱ the leading verb in the
ubi-clause. By trading, or did he
deal in slaves and lose leis property
in that?

333 f. per comitatem, by his
kindness to lu's friends ,· dum alios
seruat is the explanation of rem

. . comitate perdidit, Rud. 38.—
animi causa, sor ln’s own pleasure ,-
cf. 305 ff.

335. As mandare is used with
a persona! object and in the pas·
sive with a personal subject (1363
137 ; 158), so praemandatum
here, recommendat besorelzand.
Translate, a strong and friendly
introduction of a man lo say. . . .
The whole of Philto's speech is of
course ironical.
