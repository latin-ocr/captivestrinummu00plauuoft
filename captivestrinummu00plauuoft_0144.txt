PROLOGVS

LVXVRIA 1NOP1A

Lv. Sequere him mc, gnata, ut mi'mus fungaris tuom.
ΙΝ. Sequor: sed finem fore quem dicam nescio.

ΙΝ. Adest: cm illac sunt aedes: i intro nunciam.
Nunc, nequis erret nostrum paucis 1'n uiam
Deducam, si quidem operam dare promittitis. 5

The other prologues are for the
most part spoken by a special
Prologus and consist of long intro-
ductions to the action of the play,
varied by rather heavy witticisms.
Λ few are spoken by mythological
personages, Mercurius (Amph),
Arcturus (Rud.); the Lar Fami-
liaris is the speaker in the Aul.
and Auxilium in the Cisl. No
other prologue brings two speak-
ers upon the stage or has so
marked an allegorica] tone as this,
and no other is so artistic in its
form and its relation to the play.
It is probably from the Greek
original.

other prologues were consider-
ably changed and interpolated at
the time of the first l'lantine re-
vival, ¹50*50 n.c.; the only vsS.
here which are certainly not by
Plautus are ιδ’-ει, which injure
the form and interrupt the thought.
lt is possible that 6, 7 also are a
later interpolation3 nunc igitur
primum repeats very awkwardly
the nunc of 4 and primum of 8,
and si quidem . . . promittitis

is exactly the same as si animum
aduortitis.

1. sequere hae: a common
combination (Rud. 184; Affen.
5()2; Capt. 764, eto), which with
the answer sequor should be ren-
dered colloquially. — fungaris:
only a few cases of the 2d sing.
pass. in -ris occur in Pl.; the end-
ing -rc is frequent. The acc. with
sungm· is regular in early Latin;
see Introd. 16 b.

2. dicam: see n. on Capt. 268.

3. adest: sc. finis sequendi.—
nunciam : when it is one word, it
is always in three syllables, and
is used only in commands, with
impv., subjunc„ or fut. in impv.
sense, or rarely with a true future.
It is in sense a strengthened nunc,
and distinct from the two words
nunc iam, which mean now at last,
in contrast with some other past
time.

5. operam dare: see n. on
Capt. 6. On the omission of uos
and the use of pres. for fut. infin.
after a verb of promising, see
Introd. 24 a, h.
