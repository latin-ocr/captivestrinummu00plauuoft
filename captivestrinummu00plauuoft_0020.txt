view of lise which found expression in them was such as is

natural to a race in its decline, a philosophy of quietism‚ of · -

sniiling acquiescence in the inevitable. But the Romans at
the end of the war with Hannibal stood at the very begin-

conscious. The philosophy of life to which the Athenians

Drake. Causes somewhat similar made it impossible for an
Italian writer to reproduce in Latin the refinements of the
later Greek style. The Latin language was just beginning
to be used in literature; it was in the period of exuberance3

these matters he was not able to be consistent. His soldiers
