Ibi illa pendentem ferit : iam amplius orat :

Non satis id est mali, ni zimplius etiam, 248, 249

Quod ecbibit, quod comest, quod facit sumpti.

242. qui amat: not exactly
equal to amator, which denotes a
fixed relation, gallant, nor is quod
amat exactly amica. The latter
is often used and cf. the two to-
gether in Merc. 744, qui amat,
quod amat si habet, id habet pro
ci.bo —eius is to be supplied uith
sauiis as the antecedent of
quod.

243—255 describe the ruin of
the young man in cretic vss. which
pass into trochaics at the crisis
(252—253) with short iambic lines to
bring the thought to a close. The
metrical group and the connected
set of thoughts correspond.

243. res labitur: cf. Lucr. IV.
1 123, labitur interea res. -— foras,
away, a not infrequent use. Cf.
foras dare, to publislz and Stich.
219, foras uendere. —- labitur,
liquitur : cf. turbant, miscent, 28 5.
This asyndetic combination of
pairs of words is very common in
Pl. -liquitur makes this vs. acat-
alectic‚ while the following vss.
are catalectic.

244. si audes, if you please.
The verb audeo is for auideo (aui-
dus, aueo) and its proper meaning
is to desire, wish, not to dare.
From this sense it is weakened in
si audes to a mere phrase of cour-

teous urgency, and was so fre-
quently used as to be contracted
to sodes, 562, as si uis, used in a
precisely similar way, is contracted
to sis, 650, and si uoltis to sultis,

245. cuculus:
used as a term of reproach, Pseud.
96, Asin. 923, 934, but the origin
of the usage is unknown.

247 ff. pendentem ferit refers
to the scourging of slaves while
they were suspended by the wrists.
an extreme kind of punishment.
The reference is explained by
iam amplius orat; she goes to
extremesin her demands. amplius
here is the adverb, as orare takes
only the neut. pron, as object of
the thing—The indicatives ecbi-
bit, etc„ make it necessary to take
id as the antecedent of quod;

ni amplius etiam refers to the
further expenses complained of
below, 25¹ ff. This would make
three stages ε the single gifts, 244-
246; the further request which re-
sults in the payment of ordinary
living expenses, 247-250; and the
ruinous extravagance of 251-254.
