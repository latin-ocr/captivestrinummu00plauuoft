which seems to lie in the words themselves. On the other
hand, Plautus wrote before the regulating and, in most
respects, elevating effects of literary use had been felt in the
Latin, and the language which he used therefore preserved
many primitive forms of structure, as it preserved primitive
inflectional forms, which, as they occur but rarely in the
Classical Latin, are less fully explained in the grammars.
The study of the syntax of Plautus is therefore particularly
suggestive to the student of the history of the Latin language,
and the following summary of the more important points is
made for the use of those who know that syntax is something
more than a set of rules.

13. a) Abstract nouns in plural.

Later abstracts have concrete meaning in pL: Mil. Glor. 233, regio
astutiarum mearum, “ the realm of my sharp tricks ”3 in sing. ε capt.
250, 530; l's. 4, quae miseriae . . . te macerent, “causes of unhappi-
ness''; so amoreS‚ superbiae, etc. I‘lur. of repetition: Bacch. 1093,
omnibus exitiis interii,“ every possible kind of destruction.“ In plur.
chiefly, at all periods : facetiae, deliciae, etc. Plur. used because of a pre-
ceding plur. : Asost. 348, summis opibus atque industriis; Stich. 657
ff„ quot ego uoluptates fero, quot risiones‚ quot iocos, quot sauia,
saltationes, blanditias, prothymias; capt. 254. Cases which cannot
be classed under one of these heads are very rare.

b) Verbal nouns retain verbal force.

Governing acc. or indirect quest.: Most. 34, quid tibi . . . me aut
quid ego agam curatiost ? l'oen. 1308, quid tibi istanc digito tactiost?
“ what right hav¹e you to touch her ? ‘³ This occurs only in quis ques-
tions. Verbal nouns with est take infin. : Trin. 626, lubidost (z lubet)
audire3 Trin. 865; Ps. 552; l’ers. 121, 188, etc.

14. CAsEs. The case constructions in Pl. are fully devel-
oped. A few early constructions are found and some collo-
quialisms‚ but few of these are strictly limitecl to Pl. Some
cases (eg. acc. neut. of pronouns) are more extensively used
than in classical Latin.
