INTRODUCTION. xvii

substitutions and resolutions are freely permitted, and it is
only at the end of the verse, where the next to the last syllable
must be short, that variations from the natural order are
frequent.

11. Plautus uses similes rarely, but metaphors condensed
into a few words, or extending to a line or two, are frequent,
and constitute one of the most marked elements of his style.
They are largely drawn from public life or from military
affairs. During the twenty years of the Second Punic War
the habitual thought of the Roman people must have become
saturated with military conceptions, and these are recorded
in the popular speech in phrases or turns of thought drawn
from war. The relation of Plautus to his Greek originals
(see above, 7) is illustrated here on a small scale. The sol-
diers who appear in several of the plays, usually in a way
that holds them up to ridicule, are always Greek mercenaries;
the figures are from the Greek play, and Plautus makes no
attempt to change them into the likeness of the Roman
citizen-soldier. But the chance references to war, embodied
in metaphorical phrases, are all Roman, and are an integral
part of the language which he used. The same thing appears
to be true of the metaphors drawn from the sea and sailing
and the weather, and this fact lends some support to the
tradition handed down by Varro and Gellius that Plautus
had been a mercator, a trader by sea, before he wrote plays.

essential part, perhaps the very foundation, of verse-forms.
All primitive verse rested largely upon the repetition of
similar sounds, and after other and more complicated systems
of verse, founded upon accent or quantity or rhyme at the
end of the line, had come in, the earlier correspondences of
