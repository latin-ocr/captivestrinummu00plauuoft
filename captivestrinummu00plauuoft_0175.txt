360. quin=qm‘nc. The parti-
cle -ne is appended to the relative
when the main clause containing
the antecedent is omitted, but
would have been interrogative if it
had been expressed. Here, Do you
mean tlte young man wlco. . . :⁹ So
Amplt. 697 3 Epid. 7¹9 ; Rud.
861 ; ¹0¹9ss 1231, etc. ln a few
cases -ne is appended to the rela-
tive when the relative clause pre-
cedes the main clause.

362. mentire (pres. indic. 2d
sing.) is not an accusation of false-
hood; it means only that is not so
or you ’νε not speaking accumzlely,
as you usually do.

363 ff. fingit, fictor, ficturae :
properly of the shaping of clay
figures ς fingere is a common word
and is used here without much

thought of the proper sense, then.
as the figure grows clearer it leads
to fictor and the young man fi-
nally uses opera ficturae most
clearly in the highest sense, the
sculptor's art.

367. apiscitur: pass. from ‹zpi-
sco ; cf. indipiscet, Asin. 279. Other
verbs are at times active in Pl.
which later became deponent, eng„
opino, arbitro, aucupe, prcficisco
(only once). etc.

368. 'l'he thought is. ‘Age is
but a slight addition. a mere flavor-
ing, to wisdom, but wis-dom is
absolutely necessary to age ; with-
out wisdom age would not be
worthy of respect.' The use of
the concrete sapiens with the ab·
straet aetas makes the expression
a little hard.
