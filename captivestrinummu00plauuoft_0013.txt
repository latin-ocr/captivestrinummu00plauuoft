1. Three dates in the life of Plautus are known with cer—
tainty. He died in the year 184 B.c. (Cicero, Brutus, 60),
the Stichus was produced in the year 200, and the Pseudolus
in 191. Cicero, in the Cato Mem, 50, speaks of the latter
play as the work of an old man, and though the reference is
somewhat general, it makes it probable that Plautus was
born as early as 251. The date is usually set in round
numbers at 500 A.U.c., 254 B.C. From the oldest manu-
script, the Milan palimpsest, it is known that his praenomen
was Titus. His gentile name appears in the MSS. only in
the form lllacci, which might be the genitive of Maccius
or Maccus. Varro and Pliny the Elder use Maccius, and
this was no doubt the form of the name employed by the
Romans3 but in the prologue to the Asinaria (vs. 11) the
MSS. give Maccus. This is the name of one of the charac-
ters in the old Italian extemporaneous plays, and may have
been the original form of the name. But Roman writers
generally—Terence, Cicero, Horace, Gellius —use only
the name Plautus. This is said to be an Umbrian word,
plotus, “flat-foot‚'’ and it has been generally assumed that
it was given to the poet on account of the shape of his feet,
just as it used to be supposed that M. Tullius was called
Cicero because of a wart (cicer) on his face. In fact, very
many Roman family names are derived from physical pecu-
* liarities‚ — Rufus, Balbus, Varus, Paetus, — and there is no
reason for supposing that the poet was the first to bear the
name Plautus. He was born in Sarsina, a small town in
