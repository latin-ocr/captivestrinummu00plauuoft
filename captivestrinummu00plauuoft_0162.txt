108 PLAVTI

[u.1.5.

Vtram aetati agundae arbitrer firmiorem :
Amorin med an rei opsequi' potius par sit: ²30
Vtra 1'n parte plus sit uoluptatis uitae

Ad aetatem agundam.

Dc hac τό mihi satis hat'i liquet: nisi hoc sic faciam,

opinor,

Vt utramque rem simul exputem, iudex sim reusque ad

eam rem.
Ita faciam : ita placet.

omnium primum 235

Amoris arteis eloquar, quem ad modum expediant.
Numquam amor quemquam nisi cupidum hominem ²37²

Postulat se in plagas conicere:

237b

Eos cupit, eos consectatur, subdole [blanditur] ab re

co'nsulit :

Blandiloquentulus, harpago, mendax,
Cuppes, [auarus,] [elegans‚] despoliator,

239²
239b

Latebricolarum hominum corrumptor,

rei z explained more fully in ²72 by
the addition of fidem, honorem,
gloriam et gratiam. — opsequi,
to yicld to, is used for brevity both
with amori and with rei, though
it is suited in sense only to the
former.—uoluptatis goes with
plus and uitae with uoluptatis;
cf. Amph. 63 3. parua reses! uolup-
tatum in uita alque in aetate
‹wanda—The indirect questions
in these lines all depend upon 227.

²33 f. The change of meter
from bacchic to iambic indicates
the new mental attitude, the de-
termination to reach a decision.
—nisi expresses an exception to
the general negative implied in the
first half of the line; it is espe-
cially common in such phrases as
nescio nisi scio and equivalents
(hau licvit—iudex . . . reusque ε
the whole vs. describes what he

immediately does (ita faciam),
and means “to look well at both
sides. to state the case and reach
a decision.” — reus therefore
means pla-ader, a somewhat loose
use of the word. The figure is
dropped at once and was probably
somewhat vaguely conceived.

237. The comparison of love
affairs to hunting is elaborately
carried out in Asin. ²¹5 ff.—
postulat‚ expect ,· Capt. 186 n.

2 38 ff. ab re consulit, plans to
their disadvanthgre, i.e.‚ away from
their advantage. Cf. the opposite
in rem, 748, ex re, Men. 661.— The
glosses on these lines, enclosed in
brackets, show how far the sense
of many early or Plautine words
was lost in later times.—-latebri-
colatum ε used proleptically with
corrumptor (for form, εἰ, 114).—
celatum: gen. plu.
