'l'here is also a positive note in the play of higher tone than
is usual with Plautus. The character and situation both of
Hegio and of the two captives approach tragedy‚ and the
sels-sacrifice of Tyndarus for the master whom he loved is
most admirable. All this belongs, of course, to the Greek

Modern critics‚ however, do not rate the Captives so high.

his money by the cunning slave for the benefit of the young
lover. Hegio becomes in part the comicus stultus senex,
chiefly concerned with the humiliation of having been de-
ceived (781 ff.) ; Tyndarus uses the vocabulary of the
