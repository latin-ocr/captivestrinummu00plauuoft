PH. Quid nunc? si in aedem ad cenam

Atque ibi opulentus tibi par forte obuenerit :

Adposi-ta cena sit popularem quam uocant ε 470
Si ilh' congestae si'nt epulae a ementibus,

Siquid tibi placeat quo'd illi congestum siet,

Edisne an incenatus cum opulento accubes?

LE. Edim, nisi si ille uotet.

ST. At pol ego, esti

Edim atque ambabus malis expletis uorem 475
Et quod illi placeat, praeripiam potissumum:

Neque ill1' concedam quicquam de uita mea.
Vere'cundari neminem apud mensam decet:

Nam ibi de diuinis atque humanis cernitur.

465. sic, as l am, in contrast
with luscus.

468 ff. These lines allude to the
custom of offering a tenth to Her-
cules in the form of a feast to the
people (cena popularis, 470) in
a temple (aedem, 468). At such
a feast citizens of different social
standing might be placed near
each other at the table—par:
neighbor on the much, appears to
refer to the Greek custom, accord-
ing to which two persons occupied
one couch, not three, as at Roman
dinners.———'l‘he force of si, 468,
extends to adposita . . . sit, and
it is not necessary that si should
be repeated or that a connective
word should be used. Cf. Pseud.
863, where a condition, preceded
and followed by si clauses, is ex-
pressed without si. —- The thought
of the passage is this: ‘ Suppose
you went to a public feast, where
citizens meet οιι equal terms, and

found yourself at the table with a
richer man 3 if his clients brought
abundance of food to the table,
enough for both of you, would
you allow his wealth or position to
overawe you so that you should
take no food for yourself ?'

474. nisi si :found occasionally
also in class. Latin. It is collo-
quial in origin, but the force of si
is not wholly lost, since nisi ex-
presses an exception rather than
a condition. The clause usually
contains quis or a compound3
Ample- 825: Cure. 52; capt. 5305
but not always, Epid. 22.

477. de uita mea, of what
touches my life, i.c.‚ food and drink.

478 f. Brix quotes from Scaliger
the formula said to have been
used in introducing important
matters for (lebate in the Senate:
nulla uerecundia tws dehetdcmom-rc
a sententia dicenda, ubi de rebus
diuinis ct Immanis agitur.
