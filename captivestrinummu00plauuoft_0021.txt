are Greek mercenaries‚ but his war is Roman ; his money is
Greek, but the form of making a bargain is by the Roman
stipulatio. Such a sentence as Dabisne argenti mi hodie
uiginti minas? Dabo, contains in epitome the confusion
which is to be found throughout the plays. But in a larger
view the freedom of Plautus is more apparent. The frame
and the outlines are Greek, but the coloring is Roman. The
spirit which expresses itself in the plays is the youthful and
hopeful ancl boisterous spirit of Rome when the war with
Hannibal was at an end. In particular, the large place
which music and dancing took in the presentation of the
plays must be attributed to the influence of the germs of
the drama, which, though they remained for the most part
undeveloped, checked by the coming in of Greek literature,
had long existed in Italy. It is possible enough that Plautus
had never seen a Greek play upon the stage, and it is prob—

the tradition of the stage was Italian rather than Greek.

down to the Christian writers, and in the fact that his plays
held their place so long upon the stage. But there are also
direct expressions of opinion. Varro praises him for his
dialogue; Cicero calls his wit elegans, urbanum, ingenz'omm,
facetum ‚· Gellius says that he is uerborum Late'uormn elegan-

himself of most of the comforts of life, still retained his
Cicero and his Plautus.

But these comedies should not bc judged by the tests
which are applied to poetry. The distinction made by
Horace (Sat. I. 4. 45 ff), which denies the name of poet to
the writers of the early comedy on the ground that they
