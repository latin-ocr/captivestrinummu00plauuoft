FOURTEENTH SCENE. Char-
mides and Callicles come out of
their house, having finished their
talk about Callicles' management
of his friend's affairs.

1126. quoi: this gen. form for

i.e., he has no further claim upon
it), but what is merely loaned, this
the giver may reclaim whenever
he wants.' This interpretation is
not without difficulties. The first
vs. would be more applicable to a

quoius (queis) is supported in a
few cases by indications in the
MSS. (here B quoi), by the meter
and by the analogy of other gen.
forms. In this passage the dat.
is impossible.

1127. apsque te foret: see
832 n. and Capt. 754 n.

¹129· uideor . . . arbitror : ob
serve the triple chiasmus. With
the thought cf. Hor. A. P. 268,
uitaui denique culpam, non laudem
merut.

1130 f. nam . . . uelis:
gift which is given to a man to be
his own is wholly lost (to the given

‘for a

kindness which failed to meet with
a grateful response; prosum perit
is a strange expression for ‘is no
longer his ’ 3 and the treasure was
not loaned to Callicles (datum
utendumst) at all. But the Latin
comedy is full of allusions to the
difficulty of reclairning money de-
posited with a friend and the
danger of loss through dishonesty,
and the comparison is not more
imperfect than is common in con-
versation.

1133. fortem, good, is defined
below by optumam; so in Hor-
aee's Satires, cg„ 11. 3. 216.
