PROLOGVS

Hos quos uidetis stare hic captiuos duos,

Iuncti‘ quia astant, — hi' stant ambo, non sedent:

Hoc uos mihi testes estis nie uerum loqui.

Senex qui hic habitat, Hegio, est huius pater.

Sed 1's quo pacto se'ruiat suo sibi patri, 5
Id ego hi'c apud uos proloquar, si operam datis.

Seni hui'c fuerunt filii nati' duo:

Alterum quadrimum puerum seruos surpuit

1. hos: attracted into the acc.
by quos and taken up again in hi:
l‘ucn. 769, hi, qui . . . conciliaue-
runt . . .. id nunc his cerebrum
uritur .· l's. 592, scd hunc quem
uideo, quis lut cst? More fre-
quently used with noun and re-
peated in is, Capt. 807, 813, also
110, istos . . . is ,· very frequent in
Pl.. and cf. Verg. Aen. I. 573,
urbem quam statuo, uestra cst. The
captives were upon the stage dur-
ing the speaking of the prologue,
in order that their faces might
become known to the audience.
They reappear at the beginning of
the second act, 195, but are not
upon the stage during the first
act.

2. iuneti, etc., as to their stand-
ing ltere, chained together, they are
— standing, not sittingr ,· a joke of
the kind called παρὰ, προσδοκίαν,
where the hearer is led to expect
a conclusion of the sentence differ-
ent from that which is given. Fre-
quent in 1¹1.: Most. 253³ Bacch.

5033 Trin. 723 ff„ and found in
later writers. For iuncti quia
astant there is no precise parallel,
but cf. Capt. 2 59, Ter. Ad. 35, ego
quia non rediit filius quae cogito!
and other pass. where the quia-
clause precedes. But the text is
quite uncertain.

3. hoc, so far, but grammati-
cally to be taken with loqui.

4. huius: Tyndarus; explained
by a gesture.

5. suo sibi, lu's own: so 46.
81, Mil. Glor. 632, sua sibi ingenua
indoles, and often.

6. operam datis, give atten-
tion ,· either to listen‚ as here, or
to give aid and service. Cf. 54,
618.

8. alterum: a dactylic word
with ictus on the short penult is
very rare in the stricter meters.
A few cases are found in the first
foot of the senarius. For surpuit
=stcrrupuit, cf. 760, from which
this vs. was taken, 1011. Hor.
S. II. 3. 283, surpite.
