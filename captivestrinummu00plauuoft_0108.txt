cornic names for slaves whose
office it was to inflict punishment.
They carried thongs (lora) and
were called [orarii.

658. num does not expect a
negative answer, but, as often in
l'l., introduces a neutral question.
—lignatum. to bring wood, bind-
ing it with the lora. 'she question

contrast between it and the service
for which they were actually sum—

emphasizes messor.

662. a u d e b a s, wish, choose.
This sense of audeo is an original
one (audeo = am'dco, to be auidus ,-
cf. auco), not a colloquial weaken-
ing from the meaning dare. Ps.
78, nilne adiuuare me audes: Mil.
232 ; Asin. 476, etc.‚ and cf. sodes
(si audes), tf you please, and note
on audacia, 287. Harp- Lex· is not
exact on this word.

664-666 are probably a gloss
taken from Pseud. 4 59-461‚ where
they suit the context and situation
much better than here. Tynda-

rus does not base his defense upon ⁴

his being innocens and innoxius,
and expressly repudiates the claim
of Hegio to his loyalty‚ 707 f„ 7¹7

on the play in Introd.
