‘Quis ait: hoc? aut quis profitetur?' inquam: quasi

Neque me rident.

‘ubi cenamus una?’ inquam z atque

Dico unum ridiculum dictum de dictis melioribus,
Quibus solebam menstrualis epulas ante adipiscier:

Nemo ridet.

sciui extemplo rem de compecto geri.

Ne canem quidem irritatam uoluit quisquam imitarier,

Saltem si non arriderent, dentes ut restringerent.

Abeo ab illis, postquam uideo me sic ludificarier :
Pergo ad alios, uenio ad alios, deinde ad alios—una

Omnes de compecto rem agunt quasi in Velabro

olearii.

(Nunc redeo inde, quoniam me ibi uideo ludificarier.)
[tem alii parasiti frustra obambulabant 1'n foro. 491

479. atque: as in 481, adding
an unexpected statement, which
might be put adversatively, but is
made stronger by having the con-
trast left to speak for itself.

480. hoc=l1uc, which is the
regular word in invitations. Cf.
329 n.

481. me rident: so Ter. Ad.
548, rideo hunc, but this construc-
tion is infrequent. They were
expected to laugh at the openness
of his hint that he wanted a
<limen—inquam: repeated like
Engl. says l.— cenamus, imus z
for the tense, see Introd. 21 a.

482. unum z hardly more than
the indes. article, into which it
passed over in the Romance lan-
guages. Cf. Ps. 948, ibidem una
aderit mulier lepida; Germ. cin,
Engl. an.

484. compecto: from compesi-
scor: compingere makes pte. com-
paclus.

486. dentes restringere, show
their tectlz in a forced laugh ς
even this, though it would have
made them l'ook like snarling
dogs, would have been better than
nothing. The ut-clause is in ap-
position to imitarier; cf. 424.

489. Velabro: cf. Cure. 483:
IIor. S. II. 3. 229, with the remark
of Comm. Cruq., Velabrum lacus
Romae, uhi prostabant omnia quac
ad uictus rationem ct delicias pcrti-
nclmnt. There is a reference in
Ps. 301 f. to speculation in olive
oil and in Livy XXXVIII. 35. 5
to an attempt to corner the wheat
market, which resulted in the in-
fliction of a fine. Cf. barbarica
lege. below.
