TRINVMMVS 129

Censetur censu ad Acheruntem mortuos.

ST. Mirum quin tu illo te'cum diuitias feras:

495

Vbi mortuos sis, 1'ta sis ut nomen cluet.

PH. Nunc ut scias hic factiones atque opes

Non esse neque nos tuam neglegere gratiam :

Sine dote posco tuam sororem fssio.

Quae res bene uortat. habeon pactam? quid QOES? 50?
ST. Pro di inmortales, condicionem quoius modi! i Μ
ΡΗ. Quin fabulare ‘dl' bene uortant: spondeo' ?

ST. Eheu, ubi usus n1'l erat dicto ‘ spondeo’

Dicebat: nunc hic, quom opus est, non quit dicere.
LE. Quom adfinitate uostra me arbitramini 505
Dignum, habeo uobis, Phssto, magnam gratiam.

494. censu: with censetur, a
mere doubling of the expression.
—ad Acheruntem: a verb of mo-
tion is implied, . . . are rated in

the rating and sent to Acheron..

Plautus uses only Acheruns, -untzk,
with the first syllable long.

495 f. mirurn quin : afrequent
ironical phrase, implying the nega-
tive of the thought expressed in
the quin-clause. Lit., it is a won-
der lcow you do not . . ., i.e., lam
surprised that you don‘t. . . This
should be distinguished from mira
sunt ni (861) or mirum cst ni
(Capi. 824), which is not ironical
and implies an affirmative opinion.
—ut nornen cluet, as tlte word
means, i.e., in the full sense of
the word mortuos. The two vss.
are spoken aside, in ironical com-
ment upon the speech of? Philto,
which seems to savor of conde-
scension in saying that rich and
poor are alike after death. ‘Of
course they are. You can't take
your money with you, and you
might as well acknowledge that

 

when you are dead you are dead in
the full sense of the term.’

497 f. hic . . . non esse: Le„
that influence and money do not
count with us (hic).

500. habeon pactam z sc. rem.
Cf. Poen. 11 57, poclum rem habeto,
in a betrothal. The agreement
was made binding by the formal
question and answer, spondesne ? Ιι
spondeo, or their equivalent.

502. quin: with pres. indic. 2d
pers. this gives a distinct imper-
ative force to the question, so that
quin may even be used with the
impv. form. Cf. Introd. 23 b.

503. eheu: as an interjection
need not suffer elision. — erit
dicto: see Introd. 47. For the
construction, see Capt. 164 n. This
refers to the unfortunate sponsio
alluded to in 427, which had eost
Lesbonicus a thousand drachmae.

504. hic, in this case ς the adv„
as in 497.

505. quom: with a phrase of
emotion, habeo . . . gratiam;
Introd. 29 a.
