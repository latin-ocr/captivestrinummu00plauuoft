ιν. 1. 22] TRINVMMVS 155

Fidus fuisti: infidum csse iterant.
te, sat scio in alto
Distraxissent disque' tulissent satellites tui mefmiscrum
foede
Bonaque omnia item una mecum passim caeruleos pcr
campos :—
Ita iam quasi canes haud secus circumstabant nauem
turbines uenti : 835
Imbre's fluctusque atque procellae infensae frangere
malum,
Ruere antemnas, scindere uela—ni tua pax propitia
foret praesto.
Apage a me sis: dehinc iam certumst otio dare me:
satis* parturn habeo,
Quibus a'e'ruinnis deluctaui, fih'o dum diuitias quaero.
Sed quis hic est qui in plateam ingreditur 840³
Cum nouo ornatu specieque simul? 840b

narn apsqu<¹ foret

Pol quamquam domi cupio, opperiar:
Quam hic rem agat animum aduortam.

832. infidum esse iterant :
concessive to fidus fuisti3 cf.
Introd. 26 and f. — iterare means
to go over in words what has been
gone over in acts; so Asin. 567,
tua male facta iterari.—absque :
properly a preposition governing
te (see Lex. and Capt. 754 n.), and
the order is elsewhere apsque te
(me) foret (esset).

833 f. disque tulissent: tmesis
of preposition and verb is rare in
Pl.; quicumque is separated in a
few cases. Such tmesis, where two
words are from the same preposi-
tion, is frequent in Lucretius, eg„
I. 6 51, disiectis disque supatis.

837. ni pax . . . foret repeats
the idea of apsque foret te, re-
turning at the end of the sentence

to the thought with which it had
begun. This also makes a con-
trast to the next vs. : ‘ You have
saved me this time, but I shall
not risk it again.‘ For the same
train of thought, see Most. 431 ff.

839. quibus aerumnis implies
eis aerumnis with partum habeo.

840 ff. As Megaronides sees the
oddly dressed sycophanta his atten-
tion is attracted and he breaks off
his monologue and speaks the
next vss. in a new measure, ana-
paestic dimeter.

840. simul: added at the end
of the line, though it is connected
in sense m'th ingreditur.

841. domi: Introd. 14b‚ though
it rnay perhaps be a locative, with
esse vaguely thought of.
