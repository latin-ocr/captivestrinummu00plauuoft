Ην.. Facito ergo ut Acherunti clueas gloria.

Tm. Qui pei· uirtutem peritat, non interit.

690

llic. Quando ego te exemplis pessumis cruciaiuero
Atque ob sutelas tutis te Morti misero,

Vel te interiisse uel periisse praedicent:

Dum pereas, nil interdico aiant uiuere.

Tvx. Pol si istuc faxis, haud sine poena feceris,

695

Si ille hue rebitet, sicut confido affore.
Au. Pro di inmortales : mine ego teneo, nt'inc scio
Quid hoc si't negoti : mous sodalis Philocrates

In libertatest ad patrem in patria. .

699

Bene-st : nec quisquamst mi aeque melius quoi uelim.
Sed hoc mihi aegrest me huic dedisse operam malam,

6239. A c h e ru n ti: locative,
treated like the name of a town;
Introd. 18 d.

690. qui, etc.. lze does not perislt,
who dics sor a good dcccl. The
form peritat may be a frequenta-
tive from pereo, but more probably
contains perit confused with some
other word. Nonius, p. 424, quoting
this passage (with perit ot), says
perire et interire plurimum dgffe-
rcntiac habent quod perire leuior
res est et habet inuentionis spem et
non omnium rerum finem, and this
comment has been often repeated.
It is plain, however, that the point
of the saying lies in the fact that
the two verbs are practically syn-
onymous and that one of them is
forced into the stronger sense by
the'way in which they are used.
ln Engl. we might say, ‘ He does
not die. who dies for a good deod:
and it would have exactly the
meaning of the Latin. No such
disserence exists in common usage
between pereo and intereo or be-
tween pcrimo and interimo. The
remark of Nonius is simply made

up to suit this passage, which he
only partially understood.

691. exemplis pessumis, ih
the worst possible ways ; so istoc
exemplo, omnibus exemplis, etc..
esp. in regard to modes of pun-
ishment. Colloquial loss of mean-
mg.

692. sutelas, tricks. For the
figure, cf. Amph. 367, consuti doli,
and En gl. weh os deceit.

694. nil interdico aiant, J don’t
forbid them to say ,· cf. Trin. 994,
qui sis, qui non sis, floccum non
interritum, and interest. —aiantz
jussive subjunc., let them say that
you are alive: then nil interdico
is prefixed and the two are con-
nected paratactically. Introd. 26.

696. adfore: sc. eum ,· Introd.
²4 h. As adfore repeats rebitet,
it is more natural in Engl. to
render, as l am sure he will do.

699 f. ad patrem : Introd. 18 c.
-benest ε Introd. 20 a. —aeque
melius: cf. 828, adaeque fortu-
natior, Mers. 3 35. The explana-
tion is the¹ same as that of magis
certius, 644.
