forms aibam, scibam, audibam, are regular for aiebam, sciebam. But
synizesis in most nouns. filio, gratiis (later gratis), is rare and is con-
fined to the less regular meters.

39· Final s was into Cicero's time a lightly sounded letter: it is
frequently omitted in inscriptions, and does not make position when the
following word begins with a consonant, even in the sixth foot of iambic
senarius z saluos sis, esti‘s nunc, perdis me, etc. So also ain for ais—ne,
satin for satis-ne, etc. For this reason es, est unite freely with a pre-
ceding word ending in s ; sanu’s = sanus es, potitust = potitus est,
unicust ε unicus est, nactu’s = nactus es, etc. Examples of these
usages may be found in abundance in any play.

40· Either from frequent use or from some weakness in the conso-
nant sounds, ille, iste, inde, unde, nempe have the first syllable short:
iste has a form ste, though not in l'lautus3 in ille the double liquid
was weak (cf. olim); inde and finde may be due to weakness of the
sound of n, as nempe is certainly to be explained by the weakened
pronunciation of m.

41· That syncope occurs in Plautus, as in later Latin, is plain, e.g.:
discipulina and disciplina, poplo = populo, poclum = poculum, peri-
clum = periculum, but the extent of the usage has not been fixed.
Perhaps iuuentute in three syllables (cf. iunior) uoluptabilis in four
syllables, cauillationes in five syllables; but all of these may be ex-
plained, and usually are, by the effect of accent, 46, 47, below.

42· Α mute and a liquid never lengthen the preceding vowel irr
Plautus : exprobra, agrum, patri.

43· Many inflectional endings, which were shortened under the
influence of the accent or for other reasons before the Augustan age,
retain in Plautus invariably or occasionally their original long quantity.
Thus invariably es, indic. and impv. from esse, ὅτ in verbs (ιιοοὸῐ,
loquor). in nouus (canter, amor), in comparatives (auctibr) and in
ecastor. The original length of conjugational endings is occasionally
retained in the third pers. sing. of the perf. (uixit), of the pres. (scst‚'it)‚
of the subjunctive (sit, fuat, uelit, desideret, ete), and sometimes in
other forms (eris, eget). There are a few probable cases of a in the
nom. of the first decl. (cf. gen. in fii) and in the abl. of the third decl.
-ἓ (sermone, morte). Other early quantities differing from the Augus-
tan usage are fuit, fuimus; fieri, fierem at the end of a verse (cf. fio);
