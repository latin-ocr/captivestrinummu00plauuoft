3. The first permanent theatre in Rome was the theatre
of Pompey, finished in 55 stc. In the time of Plautus a
temporary wooden stage was erected for each performance,
and the audience stood in front of it or sat upon seats of
their own providing. From the back wall of the stage pro-
jected the fronts of three houses, and there were entrances
at the right and left sides of the stage. As will be explained
below, the plays were reproductions of Greek comedies and
the actors wore Greek dress, but masks were not used. Where
the plot of the play required that two characters should re-
semble each other in appearance, as in the Amphitruo and the
Menaechmi, the necessary likeness was produced by wigs and
paints, in the use of which the Romans were skilful.

4. ‘As there was no change of scene, there was no neces-
sity for a break in the action, though in a few plays there
were certainly brief musical interludes. Considerable parts
of the plays were given with musical accompaniment, ren-
dered upon the tibia by a player who stood upon the stage.
The portions of the comedy which are written in trochaic
septenarii (Capt. 251—360, 385—496, Trin. 301-391, 602—728‚
ete.) were declaimed or chanted while the tibicen played a
slight accompaniment in the same measure. In other scenes
the verse varied, often from line to line, the musical accom-
paniment was more prominent, and the action more nearly
resembled a dance. As this required somewhat violent
exertion, the lines were sometimes sung, not by the actor
himself, but by a special cantor, while the actor confined
himself to giving the appropriate gestures and motions. The
musical parts of the play were called cantica. The parts to
be spoken without music, the diuerbia‚ were written in iambic
senarii. In the Trimcmmus the ratio of dium-bia to cantica
is about 2 : 5, in the Captivi about 1 : 3.

the hands of the author and became the property of the
