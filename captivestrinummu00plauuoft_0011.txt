PREFACE.

—w—

THE text of these plays is from the Teubner Text ot
Goetz and Schoell'. Changes have been made not infre-
quently to get a readable text and less often to get correct
meter. A few of the more corrupt passages are left as they
appear in the MSS.

The introduction and notes are intended to be such as
will give real help to students in college classes. They
make no claim whatever to originality. The sections in
the introduction on the syntax of Plautus contain a good
deal of matter which has not before been brought together,
and may be of use to instructors as well as to students.
The remarks on the relation of the Captives to its Greek

original are new3 Ι hope they are also true.
