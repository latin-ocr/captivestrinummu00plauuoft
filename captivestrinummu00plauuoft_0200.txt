[111.2.4¹.

l't'rctus opscuraisse: atque ipsc amoris teneo omm's uias.

itast amor ballista ut iacitur: m'l sic celerest neque

uolat:

Atque is mores hominum moros et morosos efficit.
Minus placet magis quod suadetur: quo'd dissuadetur

placet.

670

Quom inopiast, cupias: quando eius copiast, tum non

uelis.

<ille qui aspellit, is compellit: 1'lle qui consuadet, uetat.)
insanum malumst hospitio deuorti ad Cupidinem.
§ed te moneo hoc etiam atque etiam ut reputes quid

facere expetas.

Si istuc ut conare facis, 'findicium tuom incendes

genus:

668. ballista: the missile, not
the machine: Capt. 796 n.

669. moros (μωρὸς) : taken over
from the Greek by Planta& and is
used especially with mos and mo-
lestus for the alliteration.

670. A combination of two
slightly differing thoughts into
one expression: non placet quod
(tibi) suadetur and eo minus placet
quo magis suadetur.

671. cupias, uelis: the indefi-
nite zd pers.

673. insanum: an adv. with
malurn; so insanum magnum,
Bacch. 761 ; insanum bonam, Most.
90& insanum bene, Mil. Glor. 24.
lt is a slang use of the word.—
deuorti: the regular word for

going to an inn or to lodge with a
friend, eg„ Pseud. 658; Mil. Glor.
¹34, 74¹-

675-678. The thought of these
lines is confused and the confu-
sion is increased by errors and
ambiguities in the Mss.

The general idea is, ⁴ lf you per-
sist in depriving yourself of that

675

property you will do an injury to
your whole family, and when you
try to recover yourself you will
only increase the injury to the
utter ruin of your posterity.’

l'ut into figurative language, this
becomes, ‘If you do this you will
be setting fire to your family
house ; then you will try to put out
the fire with water, and being a
lover and therefore a fool (as 1
have shown above), you will ut-
terly extinguish the fire and leave
not a spark on the family heau-th)
The figure has run away with the
thought. Fire, which in 675, 676
is the destroying force, becomes in
678 (and in the reply of Lesboni-
cus, 679) the spark of life (ef. 49²)
from which a new family life might
spring up. This confusion is in-
dependent of the uncertainties of
the text.

67 5. istuc: the transfer of the
ager to Lysiteles as dowry.—in-
dicium ; entirely corrupt. Tne
conjecture ordinarily adopted for
indicium tuom is incendio.
