INTRODUCTION. xxi

α) Neut. sing. pron., especially with verbs· of motion: Mil. (ilar. 1158,
id nos ad te uenimus ; Most. 786, quod me miseras; Amph. 909, id huc
reuorti; Epid. 570, quod me exciuisti; Cist. 517, haec pecco; Alost.
187, si quid erro, etc. This is the acc. of “compass and extent.''

Other varieties of acc„ found also in later writers but frequent in 1¹1„
are acc. of cognate stem (pugnam pugnare, Ps. 524; effigura etymo-
logisa), the acc. cognate (?) of partem (Capt. 421 ; Mil. 763), the acc.
neut. of adjectives (adverbial acc).

b) The acc. is regular m'th fungor (usually munus fungi); utor,
which has the abl. about thirty times, takes also acc. of neut. prom:
Alere. 145, quod quisquam uti possiet3 Asin. 199, cetera quae uolu-
mus uti‚ and the acc. with gerundive after rogo, do, peto, as also in later
Latin; Aul. 96, quae utenda uasa rogant. Rarely utor has acc. of a
noun: Pocn. 1088; Epid. 263 f., utitor consilium. For potior, see
Capt. 92 n.

17. The abl. in Pl. is fully developed. The abl. absol. is
less frequent than in later narrative writers. There are a few
idioms.

a) Abl. with facere, fieri, esse: Most. 636, quid eost argento fac-
tum? “what has become of that money?’⁷ Bacch. 334, nescit quid
faciat auro, ‘⁶ He does n't know what to do with his money”; Trin.
594, quid ea re fuat, “ what is to become of it? ”

b) Slang tex-ms for cheat'mg, circumducere, interuortere‚ tangere,
take an abl. of separation ι Ps. 431, argento circumducere.

c) aeque, adaeque with adj. take abl. of comparison ; Curc. 141,
qui me in terra aeque fortunatus erit, “ as lucky as I '’; Cas. 684,
neque est neque fuit me senex quisquam amator adaeque miser.
Cf. use of adaeque with compar. : Capt. 700, 828.

18. Prepositions have some colloquial or archaic uses :

a) By an extension of the idea of source a, ab is used of possession :
Mil. Glor. 160, quemque a milite, “ any one of the soldier’s people ”;
Ps. 735, a me dare, “ to give from my property.” Cf. Ter. Ad. 940,
de te largitor = the common de tuo.

b) cum with abl. is loosely used for the dat„ the acc„ or an adj.:
Pers. 109, mentionem facere cum aliqu03 Ps. 909, cauere; Bacch.
1056, pignus dare, etc.; capt. 203, curn catenis sumus, “chained ”i
Ps. 158, te cum securi: qui securim habes.
