Quid, homo nili, non pudet te? tribusne te

Co'llicrepidae, cruricrepidae, ferriteri, mastigiae:

iam dudum factumst quom bibi,-
Asin. 25¹· and cf. Trin. 402.

1011. The κότταβος consisted
in throwing the last drops of wine
from a cup into a metal basin in
such a way as to produce a ringing
sound⁴ — cottabi bubuli are the
blows of the ox-hide lashes. Cf.
censio bubula, Aul. 601 ; bubulae ex-
uuiae. Alost. 882.

¹0¹3 f. ecce ε Stasimus sudden-
ly remembers the ring which he
has left behind at the wine shop.
The thermipcvlium (θερμοπώλιον)
was a shop (popina) where hot
drinks were sold to slaves. —
thermopotasti : not a vox hybrzda,
as llarper's Lexicon has it, from
θερμός and pbtare. because the ο is
short here. Perhaps from aGreek
form θερμοποτεῒν. The sense is, ¹ to
warm the throat with hot drinks.'
—gutturernz masc. in Plautus;
cf. Capt. 357 n.

1015. petere: Introd. 24 c.—

re recenti, wln'le it is still fresh in

your mind. — The syllable re

occurs six times in this line.

1016. gurguliost exercitet: i.e.,
his desire for drink led him to
run to the wine shop and now 'the
forgetfulness caused by drinking
compels him to run back again.

1018. memoriam: the acc. is
regular in Pl. after obliuiscen—
There is hiatus after frugi, for
which no satisfactory emendation
has been proposed.

1020. The names are printed as
they stand in the MSS„ though
they do not make a metrical line.
It is useless to attempt to get the
original form or meaning.

1021. collicrepidae: from col-
lum and crepare, slaves who wore
a metal collar about the neck; cf.
boia, Cape. 888. The other words
are explained in Harper’s Lexicon.
For the patronymic ending, see
Capt. 472, plagtpasidae.
