INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

-erunt in third plu. perf. indic. Most of these occur rarely‚ and they
have a few parallels in Horace and Vergil: timet, uelit, steterunt, etc.

44. The strongest influencc in producing differences
between the prosody of Plautus and that of Horace and
Vergil was exerted by the accent. The Latin usage which
tended to fix the accent upon the penult or antepenult, with-
drew from the ultima a preservative force, and expedited the
shortening and dropping off of inflectional endings. This
process went on during the whole history of the language,
but it was much more rapid and extended in the spoken
than in the written Latin. For this reason, though he
preceded Vergil by a century and a half, Plautus has many
more cases of syllables shortened by the accent than any
Augustan poet.

45· Iambic words (ψ ἡ) are frequently shortened to pyrrhics
(ψ ψ), whether the last syllable ends in a vowel or a consonant. So
d6m'1', n6u6‚ n6u5, bimi, uiri; the imperatives abi, trine, uide, habe,
Bima, etc.; and before consonant5‚ dedin, uir6s, pr6cfil, parlim, cz‘ipiit,
ῐόξὲἴ, senex, etc. In mihi, tibi, sibi, ubi the influence of the accent
makes the last syllable occasionally short (common) even in classical
poetry, and regularly bEne, male. Examples of this are very common,
and in inscriptions the final consonant of some of these words is
omitted. But when the word is emphatic and therefore (listinctly pro-
nounced the final syllable may preserve its length, 113Ῑὲ, abi,

46· In the verse of Plautus the metrical ictus may exert the same
influence as the word-aecem, when it falls upon the short syllable of an
iambic combination. This is most frequent with short monos yllables
followed by a long monosyllable or by a word the first. syllable of which
is long: 'is est, an ille, p6l 11ῐο, qu6d 1n manu, per hanc, fit hunc, quis
haec, etc.; or with elision, ti'bi ergo, quia in re, nisi hunc; uith longer
words, qu6d ecbibit‚ quid exprobraS‚ age accumbe, qu6d mtellexi,
mage Inmortales, quid abstulisti, etc.

47- Further, the effect of the ictus is sometimes exerted backwards,
so as to shorten a preceding long syllable, when that syllable is itself
preceded by a short syllable. Thus dedisse exponendam, sed istac,
ego excludor, b6num ingenium, ad fixorem, per anndnam, ῖ11 6cc1'11to‚
