FouR‘rH SCENE. Hegio comes
out of his house, speaking the
first line to some one within the
house, the second to the lorarius.
He makes inquiries of the cap-
tives coneerning his son, and they
practice upon him the deceit which
they had planned in the preceding
scene.

251. It is not necessary to rec-
oncile this vs„ I will come back
into tlte house in a moment, with
the length of the scene or with the
different plan in 457 ff. These
words are put in only to give nat-
uralness to Hegio's entrance upon
the stage. —his : because he sup-
posed they would be near the
house.— isti (252): because he
did not at once see them.

252. huc produci : not exactly
the command given in 114 f.‚ but
Plautus is not careful to be con-
sistent in small matters. The ex—
aggeration of 254 is natural in the
circumstances.

253. tibi: properly with in
quaestione essemus, tlzat you
should not have to look for us ‚· so

254. moeniti (so MSS.here) =
manili. Cf. oino ploirume Ξ

munem) oinuorsci (uniuersi) in

and poena, poenire, all early spell-
ings which pass into the later ᾗ.

255 f. These vss. would have
special point, since the spectators
were already prepared to see Hegio
deceived. This is an old device
upon the Greek stage. For the
sentiment, cf. Publil. Syrus, 116,
caret periclo qui ctiam cum est
tutus cam-t.

258. praesenti pecunia: prae-
scus is a frequent term in money
