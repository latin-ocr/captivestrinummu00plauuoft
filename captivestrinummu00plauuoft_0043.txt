THE CAPTxvl.

49. The date of the composition of the Captives is not
known, either absolutely or in relation to other plays of
Plautus. The Greek original also is unknown, but no war
between the Aetolians and the people ol? Elis can have
occurred before the year 314 B.C.‚ when the Aetolians first
came into diplomatic relations with the Peloponnesian states.

50. The scene of the play is Aetolia (nam Aetolia haec
est, 94), which Plautus evidently thinks of as a city, not a
country. The action of the play opens in the forenoon
(127). The stage probably showed the fronts of two or
three honses, but only one (Hegio's) is used in the play.
The opening on the left side of the stage led toward the
harbor and foreign parts, that on the right toward the forum.

51. Camerarius, the great Plautine scholar of the six-
teenth century, says of this play, inter Plautinas omnes llaec et
argumento et expositione optima est et elegantissima, and Les-
sing called it “ das schonste Stiick das jemals auf die Biihne
gekommen ist.'' It is almost unique among the plays of
Plautus in its characters, its plot, and its general tone. Of
the stock figures of comedy given by Apuleius (Florida, ΙΙΙ.
16, p. 65, Hild.) only the parasite and the father appear.
There is no lover, no soldier of fortune, no leno, no confi-
dential slave, and no woman's part. The plot involves a
deception‚ but it is a serious deception‚ not the farcical
trickery which forms the basis of most of the plots. The
slave-life which sets the tone of other plays is not repre-
sented at all. The parts of the loz-arii, the puer, and Stalag-
mus are entirely subordinate, and while Tyndarus was a
slave in Elis he appears in the play as captiuos rather than
