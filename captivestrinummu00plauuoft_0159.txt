Nil e'st profecto stultius neque stolidius

Neque mendaciloquius neque argutum magis

Neque confidentiloquius neque peiiurius
Quam urbani adsidui ciues quos scurraS uocant.
Atque egomet me adeo cum illis una ibide'm traho:

192. numquid uis? called by
Donatus the formula abeundi,
used to avoid the appearance of
a hasty or discourteous departure.
‘Can I do anything for you?'
would render the effect better than
a literal translation. There is no
expectation of a negative answer
in numquid. The question is not
infrequently answered, as here, by
a verb in the subjunc.

193. quid ais? like the Engl.
“I say‚” is a formula to attract
attention to the real question,
which is to follow. Sometimes,
as here, the second person indi—
cates by quid uis ? that he is giv-
ing attention, but sometimes, as in
196, the main question follows at
once. Cf. also Capt. 599 n.

194. recepit, rescrved, is a legal
term.

197. iuxta . . . cum mea, like
my own, not with my own. So

iuxta tecum aeque scio, etc.—
recte facis, quite mgrlzt.

201. peiiurius: the same form
occurs in Pseud. 97 5; Truc. 612;
other forms of the adj.‚ periurus,
pejurus, and of the verb, perieram,
peierare, are found in the Mss.

202. scurras : the scurra in Pl.
is not a parasite as he is in
Hor„ but he is always alluded to
with contempt as a type of the
effeminate man<about-town. He
is contrasted with the soldier
(Epid. 15; Truc. 491) and with
the rough slave from the country
(Illost. 15), but there is nothing to
justify the statement (ΒΧ. Lor.)
that he is fi’instlidtisclz, eligant,
Aloderitter. On the contrary, his
unnatural effeminacy is alluded to
in Curc. 296, Pacu. 612, Most. 15.

203. traho, count mysclf in .· cf.
the same phrase used of accounts
in 412.
