48 PLAVTI [ιιι. 4. ιι.

Equidem tam sum seruos quarn tu, etsi ego domi liber
sui,

'l'u usqne a puero seruitutem sei‘uiuisti in Alide. 544

ΙΙι·;. Edepol minume miror, si te fugitat aut‘oculos tuos

Aut si tc odit, qui istum appelles Tyndarum pro I’hi-
locratc.

ΤΥΝ. Hegio, istic horno rabiosus ha'bitus est in Alide z

Nc'· tu quod istic fz'tbuletur auris immittzis tuas.

Na'un istic hastis insectatus est domi matrem et patrem,

Et illic isti qui insputatur morbus interdum uenit. 550

l‘roin tu ab istoc procul recedas. HE. Vltro istum a

Me rabiosum atque insectatum esse hastis meum me-
morits patrem ?

Et cum morbum mi esse, ut qui med opus sit inspu-
ta'tricr ?

Τι’Ν. Ne uerere: multos istc morbus homines mucerat,

Quibus insputari saluti fuit atquc is profuit. 555

547 ss. The atrox astutia which
suggests itself to Tynd. is to break
the force of whatever Aristoph.
may say by representing him as
subject to attacks of dangerous
madness. In such comic trickery
l'lantus 'ts extremely skilful; the
plot is usually unexpected to the
audience. and often, as here, it can
be seen that it becomes more defi-
nite and effective as the speaker
goes on : ¹ lle is mad and his talk
will be mere raving; indeed, it is
a (langerous form of insanity and
accompanied by epileptic lits, so
that you should not go near
him.' The details will increase
the sear of Hegio and the fury of
Aristophontes. —— qui insputatur
morbus: both meaning and
construction have been variously

understood. From 553 to 555 it is
plain that Plautus meant that the
patient was to be spit upon as a,
measure of healing; qui is there·
fore nom„ and tlte disease which is
spit upon is put for the diseased
person who, etc. The disease is
very probably epilepsy, but our
knowledge of the subject is
meagre.

551. ultro istum, away with
him ! Cf. Amph. 320, ultro istunc ,-
Cas. 4 59, ultro te, amator, apage te,
which shows that ultro governs an
acc. without the need of supplying
a verb.
