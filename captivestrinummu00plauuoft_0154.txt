119. ei rei refers to the thought
of 1 18, but it is also explained by
siqui (old abl.) . . . posses, which
is connected with it as a kind of
indirect question, to sec whether.

120. non uti . . . ut : the exact
phrase would be quam accedere

. . n1iscerc,but the second part
of the comparison is changed,
with colloquial freed0m3 the ad-

ciliastin are printed as they stand

lated as exclamatory or declara-
tive sentences. 1 do not feel
clear that the exclamatory -ne was
used in such sentences as these,
but I am entirely convinced that
-ne could not have the sense of
nonne in either passage, and that,
if such a sense were possible with
perf. indic. 2d sing„ it would be
entirely out of place here.

difference between giving him a
sword to kill himself and giving
him money to spend ?’ There is
tautology in quid secus est and
