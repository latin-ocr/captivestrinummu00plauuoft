154 PLAVTI [iv. ε. 4.

Quom suis me ex locis in patriam †urbis cuminam redu-
cem faciunt.

Atque ego, Neptune, tibi :inte alios deos gratias ago
atque habeo summas.

Nam te omnes saeuomque seuerumque atque auidis
moribus commemorant, 8²5

Spurcificuin, inmanem, intolerandum, uesanum: ego
contra opera expertus.

Nam pol placido te et clementi eo usque mod0, ut uolui,
usus sum in alto.

Atque hz'mc tuam gloriam iam ante auribus acceperam
†et nobilis apud homines,

Pauperibus te pare‘er'e'solitum, diuites damnare atque
domare.

Abi, laudo: scis ordine ut aequomst tractare homines:

hoc dis dignumst:

830

†Semper mendicis modesti sint.

823. quom: after a verb of
emoti0n; Introd. 29 a. The text
οἱ the latter half of the vs. is quite
uncertain.

826. contra: the adverb, as al—
ways in l'l.—opera, in fact, in
actual cxpcricncc.

827. eo usque modo ut: cf.
the lingl„ “just exactly as much
as l wanted.''

828-830. atque: almost adver-
sative, introducing a second
thought which modifies the general
bad reputation of Neptune. ‘And
yet Ι had already heard (auribus
forms one idea with acceperam)
you praised by men for this, that
you spare the poor and rage
against the rich only) The pas-
sage is not without considerable
difficulties. The latter part os
828 is corrupt. —damnarez pecul-

iar, as Plautus uses it only in the
meaning to rondemn in court. But
from the etymology the sense re-
quired here, to injure, to inflict loss
upon, is not impossible. — abi
from its literal meaning comes to
be used not only as a general ex-
pression of incredulity‚ but also,
when joined with words of praise,
as a phrase of approving dismissed,
hardly more than you may go, that
will do. Donatus (Ter. Ad. V. ι.
3) calls it uerbum uel sibi uel alteri
cum laudatione blandientis. Cf.
Ter. Adel. 456, laudo, Ctesipho, pa-
!m'ssas: abi, uirum te iudico.—
ordine, with due regard to their
condition. Charmides thinks of
himself as a poor man, in spite of
his house and his ager and the
buried treasure. It is a mere
habit of thought and speech.
