[111. 3. 71.

Mn. onrem quoquc ipsam Ι ὴίιηο rem uti celes face.
Nam pol tacere numquam quicquamst quod queat. 801
Quid nunc stas? quin tu hinc z'trnoues et te moues?
Aperi, deprome inde auri ad hanc reni quod sat est:

Continuo operito denuo: sed clanculum,

Sicut praecepi ε cunctos exturba aedibus.
ΜΕ. At enirn nimis longo sermone

CA. Ita faciam.
utimur :

8ο5

Diem conficimus, quom iani properatost opus.
Nil est dc signo quod uereare : nie uide.
Lepidast illa causa, ut commemoraui, dicere

Apud portitores esse inspectas.

denique 810

Diei tenipus non uides? quid illurn putas
Natura illa atque ingenio? iarn dudum ebriust.
Quiduis probare poterit: turn, quod maxumist,

Adferre, non petere hic se dicet.
ME. Ego sycophantam iam conduco de foro:

the speaker is about to say. In
about half of the cases the hearer
indicates by a word or two, usually
quid est ? as here, that he is listen-
ing. Cf. quid ais ? ΙΙ quid uis ? ΙΙ

502. quin: for the use in impv.
questions, see Introd. 25 d. 1t is
hardly possible that the last part
of the VS. can be correct in text,
as amoues and moues are nearly
synonymous, but no good emenda·
tion has been proposed.

804. operito: Introd. 23 a.

803. me uide: an expression of
encouragement, look to me, trust
me, used in Rud. 680 ; Alere. 1013;
Ter. And. 3 50. etc.

809. lepida is one of the ad-
jectives used very freely as a word
of praise in colloquial speech.—
dicere ; appos. of causa ; cf. 259.

811. quid illum putas . . . ?

CA. Iitm sat est.
815

what do you think about him ? i.e.,
what do you think he is doing?
So ut illam censes? Curc. 59; ut
eam credis? Bacch. 208. followed
in each case, as here, by a state-
ment of what the person in ques-
tion is doing or saying. There
must be a half-felt ellipsis of some
general verb, agere, facere, dicere,
of which the acc. is the subject.

813. The bearer of the letter is
the subject of poterit and of dicet,
814. Ile is not definitely named
before 815, because he is not
thought of in a definite way; the
main thought is that the
man m‘ll be easily deceiv
the thought of 813 f. might have
been equally well expressed in the
passive.

815. sycophantam: cf. 765 f.
and n. on 787.
