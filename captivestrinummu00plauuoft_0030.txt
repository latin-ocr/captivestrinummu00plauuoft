c) ad iu the scus-'e of apud: (itpl. 699, in libertatest ad patrem in
patria; (iifl. ρῐι»1,.μ).υὶ . . . hic ad suom maneat patrem; Asin.825,
ad amicam potare; Stidz. 43⁴) iubebo ad Sagarinum cenam coqui.

A) ln constructions of time and place prepositions are sometimes
used aud soum-times omitted without at‘secting the meaning, this varia-
tion is a survival from the adverbial stage.

With the abl. of “time when '’ no prepos. is used if the noun has an
attributixe adj.. pron„ or gen. : l'crs. 264, die un0; Truc. 497, decumo
mense3 ,lla-rc. 33. aduorso tempore. But with the noun alone in is
used z sapt. 836, in ternpore aduenis; Bacch. 1127, in anno. There
are some exceptions to this usage.

l⁴'‹·r the “time within which '' there is no sixed usage: Capt. 168,
in his diebus; Most. 238, his decem diebus; Pers. 37, in hoc triduo.

Names of towns are put in acc. of place to which, abl. of place from
which, and abl. or loc. of place iu which without a preposition, except
Ephesus (Ephesum or in Ephesum, Epheso or ex Epheso, Ephesi or
in Epheso) and in Epidaurum, in Elatiam, in Sicyonem. Piraeus and
Seleucia are always used with prepos Acheruns is treated as the name
of a town.

with names of small islands there is no fixed usage : Cyprum or in
Cyprum, Rhodo or ex Rhodo.

Names of countries usually have the prepos., but Aegypto, Most.
440; Ponto, Truc. 5403 Alidem, Cape. 573; Alide, capt. 330. Greek
names in -us are used without prepos. in good prose.

19· a) The persona] pronouns in nom. are expressed in some cases
where they are not emphatic, but the limitations of this usage have
never been accurately fixed. Plautus observes certain customs in re-
gard to order of pers. pron. ε nom. before oblique case (ego tibi, tute
tibi); subject of infin. precedes other cases (te ad me ad cenam dic
uenturum, Mose. 1134; Caj’t. 243, 249, etc.); ace. precedes other
oblique cases (me sibi, te mihi); dat. precedes abl. or acc. with prepos.
(mihi propter te). limphasis causes some departures from these
usages (Bacch. 162, tibi ego an tu mihi seruos es ?).

b) Other pronouns: hic usually refers to the speaker, even when
connected with a second pers. pron. ι Trin. 828, hanc tuam gloriam,
“this of which I arn speaking ”;' Asost. 753, hasce aedis tuas, “ where
1 now arn.'‘ So hic homo = ego, Trin. 1115, etc.; hoc caput, Ps.
723; haec canes, Trin. 172. In the same way iste usually implies a
reference to the person addressed and ille a reference to a third person.
Eut this distinction is not invariably observed.
