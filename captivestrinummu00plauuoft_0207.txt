Quem fodere metuo, sonitum ne ille exaudiat,

Neu rem ipsam indaget, dotem dare si dixerim. 755
ME. Quo paeto ergo igitur clam dos depromi potest?
CA. Dum occasio ei rei reperiatur, interim

Ab amico alicunde mutuom argentum rogem.

ΜΕ. Potin est ab amico alicunde exorari? CA. Potest.
ME. Gerrae : ne tu illud uerbum actutum inueneris: 760
⁴ Mihi quidem hercle non est quod dem mutuom,¹

CA. Malim he'rele ut uerum dicas quam ut des mutuom.

ME. Sed uide consilium si placet.
ME. Scitum, ut ego opinor, consilium inueni.

Quid est?

CA. Quid co'nsilist?
CA.

ΜΕ. Homo conducatur aliquis iam quantum potest. 765

[Quasi sit peregrinus.

755. neu =et ne‚· cf. Pseud.
32 2, ne illam uendas neu me perdas,
that you should not scll lzer and
(there-by) destroy maz—si dixe-
rim: the condition goes only with
indaget.

756. ergo igitur: this doubling
of the adverb, which in general is
characteristic of Plautus, is made
easier by the fact that (gitur still
retains much of its original de-
monstrative force. Transl. the
two together, then.

758. alicunde : here almost the
same as ab amico aliquo, though
less definite. It is used with a
verb of borrowing also, Pers. 43
and Ter. Ple. 300. — mutuom
argentum: always of a friendly
loan without interest.

760. ne: asseverative.—inue-
neris: as we say, ‘ get an answer.’

762. This is a retort to the com-
mon form (illud uerbum) of re-
fusal in 761.

The idea is: ‘ Though I want a
loan. I would rather have you tell
me frankly that you will not let

CA. Quid is scit facere postea?]

me have it than to have you shelter
yourself behind such an obviously
false statement as that.‘ The
words are not intended to apply
especially to Megaronides; for the
possibility that he might supply
the money is not considered, any
more than is the possibility that
Callicles himself might have it.
The working of the plot requires
that both these possibilities should
be excluded.

763. uide: this shortening is
especially common with iambic
impv. forms. — si, whether.

765. iam quantum potest go
together; ⁶ as soon as possible.’

766 ff. These vss. are hopelessly
confused in the MSS. and no
attempt is made in the text either
to restore the original reading
(which is impossible) or to rewrite
the passage. The general sense
is: ‘ Let some man be hired as
soon as possible and dressed care-
fully (graphice) to look like a
foreigner. Let him be a man
whose face is unknown here (non
