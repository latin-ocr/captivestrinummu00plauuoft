manuscripts. The oldest of these, and one of the oldest of
existing Latin MSS„ is a palimpsest in the Ambrosiam
library at Milan. lt was a good copy of a good original,
made in the fourth or fifth century, and contained the twenty-
one Varronian plays, but in the eighth or ninth century it
was taken to pieces‚ the parchment was cleaned‚ and some
of the leaves were used again for a copy of the Latin Old
Testament. The original writing is now very difficult to
read and many parts are missing, but where it can be read
it is of very great value. The other MSS. all belong to
one class, that is, were copied directly or indirectly from a
single archetype different from the archetype of the Milan
palimpsest. They vary in date from the eleventh to the
thirteenth century, and have been corrupted in transmission
by the errors of copyists‚ but it is possible from their read-
ings to reconstruct their original with a fair degree of accu-
racy and completeness. with the help of the Milan
palimpsest a reasonable approximation can be made to the
text as it existed in the time of the Antonines. But this is
still far from the text as Plautus wrote it; the changes due
to errors in the actors’ copies, to the revisions of theatre
managers, to intentional or unintended modernization of
forms and constructions, and to ignorance of the prosody
and metrical laws of the early Latin can be removed from
the text only by conjectural emendation, based upon an
accurate knowledge of the usage of Plautus. It is not to be
hoped that a text with such a history should ever be as
clearly fixed as the text of Vergil; a reasonable approximation
is all that can be expected.

7. The comedies of Plautus are not original plays, nor
are they simple translations; their exact position between
these two extremes is somewhat difficult to fix. The plays
of the New Comedy from which they were taken were in
part entirely unsuited for transportation to another race and
