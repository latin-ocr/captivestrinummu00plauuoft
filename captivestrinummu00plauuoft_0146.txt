Fmsr Scene. Megaronides

¹9· Philemo: one of the great
comes out of his own house, and

poets of the New Comedy, from

whose Ἐμπορος l’lautus took the
Alercator. — barbare = Latine ,-
see Capt. 492 n.; and cf. Asin.
prol. Η, Maccus uertit barbare.
ln other prologues, Mer-c. 10, Mil.
(ilar. 87, l’ocn. 54, Latine is used.

20. Trinummus: a rather acci-
dental name from the sum of
money mentioned in 843 f., as the
Rudens is named from the rope
which plays a somewhat unimpor-
tant part in a single scene. The
other plays are named after a
leading character or have their
titles in adjective form, Aulularia
sc. sabula, from the pot of money
(aula, olla), Cistellaria from the
little box, Mostellaria, the ghost
story. from monstrum. Terence
uses¹ only Greek titles. —hoct join
with nomen, 2¹.

22. ualete : the prologues to the
Casina and the Poenulus also close
with ualete, and it appears from
the prologueto the Poen. and to the
Hecyra of Terence that the appeal
for silence was not a mere form.

as he speaks the verses of this
scene moves slowly toward the
door of Callicles' house.

24. immoene facinus, a thank-
less task. The form immunis
is used in 350, 3543 cf. moenia,
munire‚· poena, punire. For the
sense, cf. lllcrc. 105, gratum et
munem and munus, a gift, a favor.
—in aetate : so 462, but usually
with hominum. Cf. Amph. 633,
in uita atque in aetate agunda, in a
passage of reflective tone like this.

25· nam: here, as often in 1³1„
introduces the reason which leads
the speaker to make the remark,
not the ground upon which he
believes the remark to be true.
So 1055, below.

27. inuitus, ni . . .·inuitet : cf.
Capt. 70, inamatus, where there is
a similar play upon the negative
in· and the preposition. The ni-
clause expresses an exception to
the negative in inuitus, and it is
not necessary to treat the sentence
as elliptical.
