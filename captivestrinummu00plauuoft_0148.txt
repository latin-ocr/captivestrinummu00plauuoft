comes out of his house, turning
back to speak to his wife and not
at first seeing Megaronides. The
first lines enable the audience to
understand that he is the master
of the house. and that he has
recently moved in.

force.

old forms of the 3d conj., as if
from ucnc‘re. So in many cases
Plautus had at his command
double forms, due to the unregu-
lated character of the early inflec-

The adj. senectus is rare and al-

most confined to the combination
with aetas. — puer: because he had
committed a fault which subjected
him to reproof. But the form
of expression is not very happy
and was chosen in order to intro-
duce the contrast between age
and youth, 45 ff. The elaborate
speeches which precede the recog-
nition of one person by another on
the stage belong to the somewhat
awkward machinery by' which the
Greek dramatist attempted to
show to the audience the thoughts
os his characters. Similar and
often much more formal recogni-
tion scenes occur all through the
plays; ag„ Bacch. 534 ᾗ, Ρ. estne
