accedito.

Si no'n ubi sedeas locus est, est ubi ambules,

Quando histrionem cogis mendicarier.

Ego me tua causa, ne erres, non rupturus sum.

Vos qui potestis ope uostra censerier ¹5
Accipite relicuom : alieno uti nil moror.

Fugitiuos ille, ut dixeram ante, huius patri,

9. Alide=Elide. Many Doric
forms came into the Latin lan-
guage from the Greeks of southern
Italy, and Plautus frequently uses
them instead of the Attic forms
which he had before him in the
original Greek play.

10. The text is metrically in-
correct, but the sense is clear.
iam adds urgency to the question,
and is several times used with
tenes, tenetis, do you get this ?
huiusce is Philocrates.

11. This verse also is incorrect
in meter, and is not satisfactory
in sense. The speaker apparently
pretends that some one in the
rear answers the question iam hoc
tenetis ? in the negative. He calls
to him to come forward, and as of
course no one responds to the in-
vitation, the speaker pretends that
it is because there is no vacant
space in front‚ and suggests that
the grumbler had better walk out.
ambulare is properly to take a
walk‚ but here ironically used for
walking out of the theatre.

13. mendicarier‚ as explained
by 14, must mean ‘⁴ to reduce him-
self to beggary by ruining his
voice-’⁹ Cf. Poen. 540, tna causa
nemo nostrorumst suos rapturus
ramices ,· Alere. 138, 151, etc. This
old infin. termination is largely

used in Pl„ almost always at the
end of a senarius or trochaic sep-
tenarius, since the long syllables
a'rier, etc.‚ make a good close. In
the 3d conj„ only verbs with long
stem-vowel, like dide-r, ‹leh-ier, take
this ending.

14. ne erres is halfway be-
tween a prohibition and a paren-
thetical clause of purpose. Such
clauses are frequent in Pl. with
a verb of thinking wrongly. Cf.
the English slang ancl ‹lon’t yon
forget it.

15f. The objector is supposed
to have gone out, and the rest of
the audience are flatteringly adx
dressed as people of property
(opibus censi), in contrast to the
citizens who had no property
(capite censi), in order to introduce
the joke of 16.—relicuom (in
four syllables, as always in PL),
tlte rest of the prologue, spoken of
as if it were a surn of money owed
to the audience. hence alieno.
— nil moror, l do not keep, dclay,
and so l clo not carc for, either
with a direct object, istos mores,
Trin. 297, or with an infin. With
a persona] object the phrase was
used of adjourning the Senate
and of discharging one who was
on trial.

17. dixeram: Introd. 21 d.
