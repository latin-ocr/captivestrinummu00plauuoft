232. fere maxuma pars . . .
homines, almost all men. fere is
used with maxuma as it is used
frequently with numerals. The
apposition of maxuma pars and
homines is an instance of para-
taxis (Introd. 26) in noun con—
struction, instead of max. pars
hominum. But the verse is un-
metrical, and it is possible that
maxuma pars is a gloss upon
fere.

236. nunc, etc. ε ‘ Now Ι will tell
you how Ι wish you to act toward
me.’—ut: in pred, see Introd-
20 a.—autumo: pres. for fut„
Introd. 21 a. Before Tyndarus
could describe the conduct he
desired, the opposite of that de-
scribed in 232 ff„ Philocrates
breaks in with assurances of his
sincerity and then pass-es on to
further urgings and directions.

237 ff. The sense is, (6 Your re-
minder that Ι should owe you
much is well-founded, but) Ι would
not persuade [potential] you to do
anything which Ι would not per-
suade my dearest friend to do, or

even my own father. In fact, Ι
might, if I chose, properly call
you my father, for next to my
father you have been most like a
father to mel-audeam: in the
earliest sense, ‘wish‚ choose';
see n. on 662. The condition is
an ideal or general one referring to
the future, not the condition con-
trary to fact, described in Introd.

240. ted: the final d is the old
ending of the abl. sing, found
with nouns (Gnaiuod= Gnaeo, in
poplicod =in publico, dc senatuos
sentcntiadz de senatus sententia)
and with pronouns. It had passed
out of common use in the time of
Plautus except in med, ted, scd,
which by a confusion of forms
were sometimes used for the acc.
as well as for the abl.

240 ff. ‘ And because I am sure
that my request is justifiable
[propterea refers to 237—239]‚ Ι
warn you not to forget that I am
now not the master but the slave.
[non ego . . . sum is logically
the object of memineris; Introd.
