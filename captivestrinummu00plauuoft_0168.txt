11⁴ 1‘11AVT1 [ιι. 2. 25·

Vtrum itane esse nniuelit ut eum animus aequom
censeat,

:ln ita potius ut parentis eum esse et cognati uelint:

Si ‘linimus hominem pepulit, actumst, {inimo seruit, non

sibi:

Si ipse animum pepulit, dum uiuit, uictor uictorum
cluet.

Tu si animum uicisti potius quam Animus te, est quod
gaudeas. 3¹0

Nimio satiust ut opust te ita esse quam ut animo lubet.

(Qui {inimum uincunt quani quos animus semper pro-
biores cluent.)

Lr. istaec ego mihi se'mper habui aetati integumen-

tum meae,
Nc'· penetrarem me usquam, ubi esset damni concilia—
bolum, 3¹4

Ne noctu irem obambulatum neu suom adimerem alteri,

306. utrum with double ques-
tions retains in I'l. much of its
original sense, wlu'clc as‘tlte two.

307. For a moment the figure
changes and the parents and rela-
tives stand for the man’s own
better choice. The next lines re-
turn to the original idea.

308 f. actumst and uiuit are
contrasted, and seruit and uictor.
There are familiar lengi. phrases
like uictor uictorum and cf. regrum
rex, Cast. 825. For the thought,
cf. Hor. Ep. Ι. 2. 62, animum rege,
qui nisi paret, imperat.

3¹ 1. nimio, macla see Capi. 102
n. This is the regular sense in Pl.

312 is a mere repetition of the
thought of 309. It uses the plural
while all the rest of the speech has
been in the singular, and instead
of probiores we· should expect

probi with cluent, which contains

in itself the idea of eminence
which the comparative here would
give. The vs. is plainly a gloss.
Not so 311, which is a real sum-
mary of the preceding.

313. istaec: i.e.‚ such precepts
as those which you have been ex-
pressing with the reference to the
second person proper to iste.—
aetati: not as in the frequent use
of aetas mea = ⁶:4⁷0, but with refer-
ence to adulescentia 301, ine-
unte aetate 30 5.

3¹4· conciliabolum: perhaps
here a translation of σύλλογος, as
irem obambulatum may be of
κωμάζειν. ΊῚιε opening scene of the
Bacchides is the best commentary
on these lines, esp. 66, penetrem
me huiusmodi in palaestram, ubi
dam nis desudascitur ?
