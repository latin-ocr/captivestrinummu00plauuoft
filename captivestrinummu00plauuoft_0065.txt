184 ff. The hare is the melior
condicio of 179 f.‚ the weasel the
small and tough dinner of Hegio.
Cf. the proverb about the hare,
Ter. Eun. 426. The next vs. is
less clear: ‘My food (way of living)
goes over a stony road ’; but we
should expect ‘my guest has a
hard road to travel,' and so it is
taken by Erg. in his answer, ‘ I will
come with my teeth well shod, to
suit your rough road.’ This is the
carelessness of conversation, in
which the figures are not scruti-
nized closely if they correspond in
affaiffihfissssgsstffisss 5535? 335:
pect ,· postulo is very common in
this weakened sense in Pl. and
Ter.; Capt. 717; 739; Ps. 101 ;
378, etc. See also Cic. in Caccil.
34; ad Fam. XI. 28. 4.

188. sane, l acknowlczlgre, that
is, ‘you are quite right to have
your teeth shod, for my way of
living is rough.’

189. terrestris cena, a dinan-r
‹fflzcrbs, of products of the soil,
without meat; in terrestris be-
stia the meaning is turned to land
animal. Pork in various forms
was a favorite meat of the time of
Plautus. Cf. 903 ff.

191. numquid uis? This sar-
mula abeundi occurs in various
forms, numquid aliud ? 448, ιιιιηι-
quid me aliud? etc., as a polite
way of expressing an intention of
going away, and continued in use
as late as the time of Horace (S.
Ι. 9. 6). It was regularly answered
by recte or ualcas (Donatus on
Ter. Ad. III. 3. 78)‚but sometimes,
as here, by a request3 ut. . . recl-
eas, 448. — memorem mones z
a common saying, like currentem
incilare, actum agere. Erg. goes
off by the right-hand exit to the
forum.

192. ratiunculam, quantillum:
the diminutive forms are used
without diminutive sense. Cf.
the colloquial use of frequenta-
tives for the simple verb.
