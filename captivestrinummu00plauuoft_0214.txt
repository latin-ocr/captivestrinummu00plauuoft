SENEX

Sv. Huic ego die nomen Trinummo fficio: nam ego

operam meam

Tribus nummis hodie locaui ad zirtis naugatorias.
Aduenio ex Selei'icia, Macedonia, Asia atque Arabia, 845
Quils ego neque oculis nec pedibus {unquam usurpaui

meis.

Viden egestas quid negoti dzit homini misero mali?
Quin ego nunc subigor trium nummum caiisa ut hasce

epistulas

Dicam ab eo homine me decepisse, quem ego qui sit

homo nescio

Neque noui neque nzitus necne is ft'ierit id solide scio.
Cn. Ρό] hic quidem fungino generest: capite se toti'im

tegit.

851

Hilurica facies uidetur hominis: eo ornatu eiduenit.

ΤΕΝΤΙΙ SCENE. The sycophanta
comes upon the stage from the
left wearing 3 cloak and a large
hat. The foreign characteristics
of his dress were probably exag-
gerated to give point to 851 f.
Megaronides watches him from
one side, but is supposed not to
hear the soliloquy. 843-868.

843. die :dici and monosyl-
labic by synizesis. ·

844. tribus nummis : there are
no references in Pl. to Roman
money. For the Greek coins
mentioned in the original he ordi-
narin uses Greek names, dra-
chuma, Philippus, mina (μνᾶ), 311(1
talentum, and the money reckon-
ings are for the most part accu-
rate. But he also uses nummus
in a somewhat general way, for 3
drachma, for 3 two-drachma piece

(the most common use), and with
aureus for 3 Philippus. In a few
cases it is used proverbially of a
very small sum (en-,g Capt. 331).
llere the indefiniteness is in-
creased by the use of tribus; cf.
tmhus uerbis, 963, and trtum num-
mum causa, Most. 357.'—nauga-
torias : cf. 819 11. For the varia-
tion in form, cf. claudus, clodus,
cludus; fraus and frudo.

8 50 fuerit natus necne: an in-
direct question depending on
scio. —solide (also' 111 892): 3 bit
of slang like insanum, 673.

851. capite (abl. of means) in-
cludes the large hat.

851-1i1urica= lllyrica; cf.
fllen. 2 3 5 Htlurios with first sylla-
ble short. There was probably
some hit here, intelligible to the
audience, but now lost.
