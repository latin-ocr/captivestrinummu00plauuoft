Nox datur: ducitur faimilia tota,
Vestiplica, unctor, auri custos, flabelliferae, sandali-

gerulae,

Cantriccs, cistellatrices, nuntii, renuinfii,

Raptores panis et peni.

Fit ipse, dum illis comis est,

Inops amator.

Hace ego quom cum animo meo reputo,

Vbi qui eget, quam preti sit parui,
Apage te, amor, non places, n1'l te utor.
Quamquam sslud cst dulce, esse et bibere,

Amor amari dat tamen satis quod aegre sit.

Fugit forum, fugat suos cognatos,
Fugat ipsus se ab suo contutu,
Neque eum sibi amicum uolunt diei.

Mille modis amor ignorandust,
Procul abhibendust atque abstandus ε

ular forms are -uis and -i, the
latter being the usual one.

252 ff. Λ similar list of wom-
en’s attendants is given in Aul.
500—520. — raptores: not an-

(frum penus‚s›cnum): not sharply

puto and its subject is to be sup-
plied from ubi qui eget in which
qui ἰς the indes. pron. The real
leading verb would be something
like lsay to myseff, but the thing
said, apage te, is put in its place.
The whole sentence is extremely
colloquial in ἱστίη. —nil te utor:

capt. 16. and the Engl. slang
phrase, l have no use for you.

259. illud refers to esse et
bibere, treated as a single expres-
sion for all sels-indulgence.

260. amari: with satis—aegre
sit: see Introd. 20 a.

261. That is, the lover, in his
folly, seeks solitude and, by his
follies, drives away his friends.

264. abhibendus‚ kept ff does
not occur in any Latin author and
is put into the text here only
exempli gratia. — abstandust,
must be held ff involves a transi-
tive use of stare. The distinction
between transitive and intransitive
verbs is not sharply observed even
in class. Latin and was probably

a matter of slow growth in the <

langauge. Cf. placenda dos est,
